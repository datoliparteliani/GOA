        <h1>Basketball</h1>
        <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a
            rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24
            cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048
            m) high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through
            their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is
            worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is
            given one, two or three one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins,
            but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
            Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate,
            both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots â€“ the layup, the
            jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots;
            either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
            It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the
            ball with both hands then resume dribbling. The five players on each side fall into five playing positions.
            The tallest player is usually the center,
            the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small
            forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who
            implement the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player
            positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one. Invented in 1891 by
            Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, in the
            United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed
            sports.[1][2] The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball
            league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition[3][4] (drawing most
            of its talent from U.S. college basketball). Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues
            qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas.
            The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of
            the sport and attract top national teams from around the world. Each continent hosts regional competitions
            for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup. The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's
            Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams
            from continental championships. The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I
            Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague
            Women.</p>

        <h2>Creation</h2>
        <p>In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian-American professor of physical education and instructor at the
            International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield,
            Massachusetts,[7] was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.[8] He sought a vigorous indoor
            game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters.
            After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new
            game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a
            basket mounted on a wall. Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track.
            Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be
            retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored. This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the
            bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket.</p>
