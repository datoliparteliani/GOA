            <p>Svaneti or Svanetia (Svan: შუ̂ან, ლემშუ̂ანიერა shwan, lemshwaniera, Suania in ancient sources; Georgian:
                სვანეთი Svaneti) is a historic province in the northwestern part of Georgia. Running along the Greater
                Caucasus range, Svaneti is one of the most mountainous regions of Georgia. It is largely inhabited by
                the Svans, an ethnic subgroup of Georgians.</p>

            <h2 id="geo">Geography</h2>
            <p>Situated on the southern slopes of the central Caucasus Mountains and surrounded by 3,000–5,000 meter
                peaks, Svaneti is the highest inhabited area in the Caucasus. Four of the 10 highest peaks of the
                Caucasus are located in the region. The highest mountain in Georgia, Mount Shkhara at 5,201 meters
                (17,059 feet), is located in the province. Prominent peaks include Tetnuldi (4,974 m / 16,319 ft), Shota
                Rustaveli (4,960 m / 16,273 ft), Mount Ushba (4,710 m / 15,453 ft), Ailama (4,525 m / 14,842 ft), as
                well as Lalveri, Latsga and others. They are separated by the Svaneti Range which is almost as high as
                the main Caucasus range. Historical Svaneti also included the Kodori Gorge in the adjoining rebel
                province of Abkhazia, and part of the adjacent river valleys of Kuban and Baksan north of the crest of
                the Caucasus. Writing in 1848, Bodenstedt said that Upper Svaneti could only be reached by a difficult
                footpath that was closed in winter.</p>

            <h2 id="land">Landscape</h2>
            <p>The landscape of Svaneti is dominated by mountains that are separated by deep gorges. Most of the region
                which lies below 1,800 meters (5,904 ft) above sea level is covered by mixed and coniferous forests. The
                forest zone is made up of tree species such as spruce, fir, beech, oak, and hornbeam. Other species that
                are less common but may still be found in some areas include chestnut, birch, maple, pine and box. The
                zone which extends from 1,800 meters to roughly about 3,000 meters (5,904–9,840 ft) above sea level
                consists of alpine meadows and grasslands. Eternal snows and glaciers take over in areas that are over
                3,000 meters above sea level. The region is notable for its glaciers and picturesque summits. Svaneti's
                signature peak is probably Mount Ushba which towers over the Inguri Gorge and can be seen from many
                parts of the region.</p>

            <h2 id="cli">Climate</h2>
            <p>The climate of Svaneti is humid and is influenced by the air masses coming in from the Black Sea
                throughout the year. Average temperatures and precipitation vary considerably with elevation. Annual
                precipitation ranges between 1000 and 3200 mm (39 and 126 inches). The highest amount of precipitation
                falls on the Greater Caucasus Mountains. The region is characterized by very heavy snowfall in the
                winter and avalanches are a frequent occurrence. Snow cover may reach 5 meters (16.4 feet) in some
                areas. In general, the lowest regions of Svaneti (800–1200 meters / 2624–3936 feet above sea level) are
                characterized by long, warm summers and relatively cold and snowy winters. Middle altitudes (1200–1800
                meters above sea level) experience relatively warm summers and cold winters. Areas above 2000 meters
                above sea level lie within a zone that experiences short, cool summers (less than 3 months) and long and
                cold winters. Large parts of Svaneti lie above 3000 meters (9840 feet) above sea level, a zone that does
                not have a real summer. Due to Svaneti's close proximity to the Black Sea, the region is spared from the
                extremely cold winter temperatures that are characteristic of high mountains.</p>

            <h2 id="his">History</h2>
            <p>The Svans are usually identified with the Soanes mentioned by Greek geographer Strabo, who placed them
                more or less in the area still occupied by the modern-day Svans. The province had been a dependency of
                Colchis, and of its successor kingdom of Lazica (Egrisi) until AD 552, when the Svans took advantage of
                the Lazic War, repudiated this connection and went over to the Persians.[2] The Oxford Dictionary of
                Late Antiquity notes that "this seems to have reflected a general Suanian preference for the alliance to
                Persia, set against a Lazican preference for Roman alliance, which was to remain a point of tension
                until the Arab conquests".[2] The Byzantines wanted the region, for if they secured its passes, they
                could prevent Persian raids on the border areas of Lazica. With the end of the war (562), Svanetia again
                became part of Lazica. Then, the province joined the Kingdom of Abkhazia (John and Adarnase of the
                Shavliani dynasty, 871–893) to form a unified monarchy which was incorporated into the Kingdom of
                Georgia in the early 11th century. Svanetia became a duchy (saeristavo) within it, governed by a duke
                (eristavi). The province's Orthodox culture flourished particularly during the Georgian “golden age”
                under Queen Tamar (r. 1184–1213), who was respected almost as a goddess by the Svanetians. The legend
                has it that the duchy was annually visited by Tamar. The Svans had been known as fierce warriors for
                centuries. Their inflatable war banner was named Lemi (Lion) because of its shape. The marauding Mongols
                never reached Svanetia and, for a time, the region became a cultural safe house.
                Following the final disintegration of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 1460s, fighting broke out for
                controlling the province. Part of Upper Svanetia formed an independent principality under the Princes
                Dadeshkeliani, a branch of the Gelovani family, while Lower Svanetia, originally ruled by the Princes
                Gelovani, was temporarily usurped and subdued by the Mingrelian princes Dadiani. Facing serious internal
                conflict, Prince Tsioq’ Dadeshkeliani of Svanetia signed a treaty of protectorate with the Russian
                Empire on November 26, 1833. Difficult to access, the region retained significant autonomy until 1857,
                when Russia took advantage of the dynastic feud in Svanetia and effectively abolished the principality's
                autonomy. In 1875, the Russians toughened their rule by imposing additional taxes. Protests ensued, and
                Russia deployed troops against the province. Despite having suffered heavy losses, the Russian army
                units eventually crushed the rebels burning their stronghold Khalde to the ground in 1876. Part of the
                Russian governorate of Kutais, Svanetia was divided into two raions (districts) — Mestia
                (former Sethi) and Lentekhi — under the Soviet rule. The unsuccessful anti-Soviet Svaneti uprising took
                place in the region in 1921. In 1987, avalanches destroyed several homes and killed at least 80, many of
                them schoolchildren. In the aftermath the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
                and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed a decree to resettle some 2,500 families to
                districts of eastern Georgia (eco-migration to Marneuli, Tetritskaro, Bolnisi, Sagarejo, Gardabani,
                Dmanisi, Kaspi, Tskaltubo, Khoni, Ozurgeti, and Lanchkhuti rayons).[3] The end of the Soviet Union and
                subsequent Georgian Civil War created severe socioeconomic problems in the region. While the Svanetian
                population resisted the unpleasant conditions of the high mountain environment they lived in for
                centuries, the increasing economic difficulties of the last two decades and frequent natural disasters —
                floods and landslides as of April 2005 ([1]) have brought about a strong tendency towards migration. The
                province became a safe haven for criminals threatening local residents and tourists. Large-scale
                anti-criminal operations carried out by the Georgian Special Forces as of March 2004 [4] resulted in
                significant improvement of the situation.</p>

            <h2 id="popu">Population</h2>
            <p>The Svans, the indigenous population of Svanetia, are an ethnic subgroup of the Georgians. Until the
                1930s, Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader
                category of Georgian thereafter. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the
                4th-6th centuries. However, some remnants of old paganism have been maintained. Saint George (known as
                Jgëræg to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained
                many of their old traditions, including blood revenge. Their families are small, and the husband is the
                head of his family. Typically bilingual, they use both Georgian and their own, unwritten Svan language,
                which together with
                the Georgian, Mingrelian, and Laz languages constitute the South Caucasian or Kartvelian language
                family.</p>
