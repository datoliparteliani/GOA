        <h1>Apples</h1>
        <p>An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard
            apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the
            genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found.
            Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European
            colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and
            European Christian tradition. Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents,
            and the resultant fruit
            frequently lacks desired characteristics. For commercial purposes, including botanical evaluation, apple
            cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be
            larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the
            size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting. There are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples.
            Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses,
            including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal,
            bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010,
            the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple
            production.</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 metres (6 to 15 feet) tall in cultivation and up
            to 15 m (49 ft) in the wild, though more typically 2 to 10 m (6.5 to 33 ft). When cultivated, the
            size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method.[5] Apple trees may
            naturally have a rounded to erect crown with a dense canopy of leaves.[6] The bark of the trunk is dark gray
            or gray-brown, but young branches are reddish or dark-brown with a smooth texture.[1][7] Young twigs are
            covered in fine downy hairs; they become hairless when older. The buds are egg-shaped and dark red or purple
            in color; they range in size from 3 to 5 millimeters, but are
            usually less than 4 mm. The bud scales have very hairy edges. When emerging from the buds, the leaves are
            convolute, meaning that their edges overlap each other.[1] Leaves can be simple ovals (elliptic), medium or
            wide in width, somewhat egg-shaped with the wider portion toward their base (ovate), or even with sides that
            are more parallel to each other instead of curved (oblong) with a narrow pointed end.[7][1] The edges have
            broadly-angled teeth, but do not have lobes. The top surface of the leaves are glabrescent, almost hairless,
            while the undersides are densely covered in fine hairs.[1] The leaves are attached alternately by short leaf
            stems 1-to-3.5 cm (1⁄2-to-1+1⁄2 in) long. Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of
            the leaves and are produced on spurs and
            some long shoots.[5] When the flower buds first begin to open the petals are rose-pink and fade to white or
            light pink when fully open with each flower 3-to-4-centimeter (1-to-1+1⁄2-inch) in diameter.[1] The
            five-petaled flowers are group in an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 3–7 flowers.[8] The central
            flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.[6]
            Open apple blossoms are damaged by even brief exposures to temperatures −2 °C (28 °F) or less, although the
            overwintering wood and buds are hardy down to −40 °C (−40 °F).</p>
