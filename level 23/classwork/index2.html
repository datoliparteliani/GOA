                <p>Pirates of the Caribbean is an American fantasy supernatural swashbuckler film series produced by
                    Jerry
                    Bruckheimer and based on Walt Disney's theme park attraction of the same name. The film series
                    serves as
                    a major component of the titular media franchise. Based on a fictionalized version of the Golden Age
                    of
                    Piracy (c. 1650–1726), the films' plots are set primarily in the Caribbean. Directors of the series
                    include Gore Verbinski (films 1–3), Rob Marshall (4), Joachim Rønning (5), and
                    Espen Sandberg (5). The series is primarily written by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (1–4); other
                    writers
                    include Stuart Beattie (1), Jay Wolpert (1) and Jeff Nathanson (5).The stories follow the adventures
                    of
                    Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), with Hector Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and Joshamee Gibbs (Kevin
                    McNally) over the course of the films. Other characters featured in the original trilogy include
                    Will
                    Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), James Norrington (Jack Davenport),
                    Governor
                    Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook), Marty
                    (Martin
                    Klebba), Cotton (David Bailie), Murtogg and Mullroy (Giles New and Angus Barnett), Lieutenant
                    Gillette
                    (Damian O'Hare), Theodore Groves (Greg Ellis), Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), Lord
                    Cutler

                    Yun-Fat). Despite focusing more on Jack Sparrow among several of the aforementioned characters, the
                    fourth and fifth films serve as standalone sequels. The fourth film features Angelica (Penélope
                    Cruz),
                    Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Philip Swift (Sam Claflin), Syrena (Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey), and Scrum
                    (Stephen
                    Graham). The fifth film features Armando Salazar (Javier Bardem), Henry Turner (Brenton Thwaites),
                    and
                    Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario).</p>
