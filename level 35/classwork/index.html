        <p class="p1">Deante Adam Johnson (born November 18, 1999), known professionally as Summrs, is an American
            rapper and
            singer. He signed with Victor Victor Worldwide and Capitol Records in 2021, but left the following year and
            later signed with 10K Projects. He is best known for his releases on SoundCloud. In April 2018, Summrs
            appeared on Florida rapper Weiland's single "Who's Better". He rose to prominence as a pioneering figure
            in the PluggnB subgenre in 2018, releasing a series of projects, most notably ##Endeavor777 and Devotion, as
            well as ##Bellworld, followed by ##Bellworld 2, No Regrets and Revived. Summrs received praise for the
            single "Shouldve Known" featuring Cash Bently, released through SoundCloud in February 2019. Pitchfork Media
            declared it "the must-hear rap song of the day." Summrs released Isolation, a 15-track album on October
            15, 2019. In January 2021, Summrs appeared on the single "Mother of My Kids" by TyFontaine. He again
            collaborated
            with TyFontaine on the deluxe version of his album Ascension. In December 2021, he released a SoundCloud
            exclusive track with Yeat titled "Countup". He appeared on Thai rapper 1Mill's album Only1 in March
            2022. June 2022 marked the release of his debut full-length album Fallen Raven, featuring the tracks
            "Swing Ya Pole" and "So Much Cheese", both of which garnered mainstream attention. In late 2024 he gained
            more recognition with his single "Marble Floors" on his NIGHTFALL EP and his "GO2WORK" feature on Yeat's
            album Lyfestyle.</p>

                <p>Chris Richards of The Washington Post describes Summrs' musical style as "sticky, Auto-Tuned rhymes
                    sounding as if they were melting the midday sun." Summrs is known for being one of the main
                    pioneers of the pluggnb subgenre of plugg music. Pitchfork writer Alphonse Pierre compares Summrs'
                    vocal style to Lil Tracy, with more influences from R&B.</p>
