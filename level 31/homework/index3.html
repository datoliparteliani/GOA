                <p>Joel Daniel Coen (born November 29, 1954)[1] and Ethan Jesse Coen (born September 21, 1957),[2]
                    together known as the Coen brothers (/ˈkoʊən/), are an American filmmaking duo. Their films span
                    many genres and styles, which they frequently subvert or parody.[3] Among their most acclaimed works
                    are Blood Simple (1984), Raising Arizona (1987), Miller's Crossing (1990), Barton Fink (1991), Fargo
                    (1996), The Big Lebowski (1998), O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), No Country for Old Men (2007), A
                    Serious Man (2009), True Grit (2010) and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013). The brothers generally write,
                    direct and produce their films jointly, although due to DGA
                    regulations, Joel received sole directing credit while Ethan received sole production credit until
                    The Ladykillers (2004), from which point on they would be credited together as directors and
                    producers; they also shared editing credits under the alias Roderick Jaynes. The duo started
                    directing separately in the 2020s, resulting in Joel's The Tragedy of Macbeth (2021) and Ethan's
                    Jerry Lee Lewis: Trouble in Mind (2022) and Drive-Away Dolls (2024). They have been nominated for 13
                    Academy Awards together, plus one individual nomination for each, sharing Best Original Screenplay
                    for Fargo, and Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay for No Country for Old Men.
                    They won the Palme d'Or for Barton Fink at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. The Coens have written
                    films for other directors, including Sam Raimi's Crimewave (1985), Angelina
                    Jolie's World War II biopic Unbroken (2014) and Steven Spielberg's Cold War drama Bridge of Spies
                    (2015). They produced Terry Zwigoff's Bad Santa (2003) and John Turturro's Romance and Cigarettes
                    (2005). Ethan is also a writer of short stories, theater and poetry. They are known for their
                    distinctive stylistic trademarks including genre hybridity.[4] No Country
                    for Old Men, A Serious Man and Inside Llewyn Davis were included on the BBC's 2016 poll of the
                    greatest motion pictures since 2000.[5] In 1998, the American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Fargo
                    among the 100 greatest American movies.[6] Richard Corliss wrote of the Coens: "Dexterously flipping
                    and reheating old movie genres like so many pancakes, they serve them up fresh, not with syrup but
                    with a coating of comic arsenic."</p>

                <h2 id="h2-1">Career</h2>
                <p>After graduating from New York University, Joel worked as a production assistant on a variety of
                    industrial films and music videos. He developed a talent for film editing and met Sam Raimi while
                    assisting Edna Ruth Paul in editing Raimi's first feature film, The Evil Dead (1981). The duo made
                    their debut with Blood Simple (1984). Set in Texas, it tells the tale of a bar owner
                    (Dan Hedaya) who hires a detective (M. Emmet Walsh) to kill his wife and her lover (Frances
                    McDormand and John Getz, respectively). It contains elements that point to their future direction:
                    distinctive homages to genre movies (in this case noir and horror), plot twists layered over a
                    simple story, snappy dialogue and dark humor. Janet Maslin wrote: "The camera work by Barry
                    Sonnenfeld is especially dazzling. So is the fact that Mr. Coen, unlike many people who have
                    directed great-looking film noir efforts, knows better than to let handsomeness become the film's
                    entire raison d'être. In addition to its stylishness, Blood Simple has the kind of purposefulness
                    and coherence that show Mr. Coen to be headed for bigger, even better, things."[25] Joel's direction
                    was recognized at the Sundance and Independent Spirit awards.[26] It was the first film shot by
                    Sonnenfeld, who collaborated with the Coens on their two subsequent films and went on to be a
                    director. It marked the first of many collaborations between the Coens and composer Carter Burwell.
                    It was also the screen debut of McDormand, who went on to feature in many of the Coens' films (and
                    marry Joel). Their next project was Crimewave (Raimi, 1985), written by the Coens and Raimi. Joel
                    and Raimi also
                    made cameos in Spies Like Us (1985). The brothers wanted to follow their debut with something
                    fast-paced and funny. Raising Arizona
                    (1987) follows an unlikely married couple: ex-convict H.I. (Nicolas Cage) and police officer Ed
                    (Holly Hunter), who long for a baby but are unable to conceive. When furniture tycoon Nathan Arizona
                    (Trey Wilson) appears on television with his newly born quintuplets and jokes that they "are more
                    than we can handle", H.I. steals one of the quintuplets to bring up as their own. Pauline Kael noted
                    its "cornpone-surreal quality" and wrote that the Coens "are going with their strengths. They're
                    making a contraption, and they're good at it because they know how to make the camera behave
                    mechanically, which is just right here—it mirrors the mechanics of farce ... The Sunsets look
                    marvellously ultra-vivid; the paint doesn't seem to be dry—it's like opening day at a miniature-golf
                    course."[28] Geoff Andrew wrote: "the lives and times of Hi, Ed and friends are painted in
                    splendidly seedy colours, turning Arizona into a mythical haven for a memorable gaggle of no-hopers,
                    halfwits and has-beens. Starting from a point of delirious excess, the film leaps into dark and
                    virtually uncharted territory to soar like a comet."[29] The film featured McDormand, William
                    Forsythe, Sam McMurray, Randall "Tex" Cobb and marked the first of many collaborations between the
                    Coens and John Goodman.</p>
