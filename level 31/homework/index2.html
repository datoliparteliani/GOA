                <p>Quentin Jerome Tarantino (/ˌtærənˈtiːnoʊ/; born March 27, 1963) is an American filmmaker, actor, and
                    author. His films are characterized by stylized violence, extended dialogue often featuring much
                    profanity, and references to popular culture. His work has earned a cult following alongside
                    critical and commercial success; he has been named by some as the single most influential director
                    of his generation and has received numerous awards and nominations, including two Academy Awards,
                    two BAFTA Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards. Tarantino began his career with the independent
                    crime drama film Reservoir Dogs (1992). His second
                    film, the crime drama Pulp Fiction (1994), was a major success and won numerous awards, including
                    the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. He next
                    wrote and starred in the action horror film From Dusk till Dawn (1996). His third film as director,
                    the crime drama Jackie Brown (1997), paid homage to blaxploitation films. Tarantino wrote and
                    directed the martial arts films Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003) and Kill Bill: Volume
                    2 (2004), with both volumes combined regarded as a single film. He then made the
                    exploitation-slasher film Death Proof (2007), which was part of a double feature with From Dusk till
                    Dawn director Robert Rodriguez, released under the collective title Grindhouse. His next film,
                    Inglourious Basterds (2009), followed an alternate account of World War II. He followed this with
                    Django Unchained (2012), a slave revenge Spaghetti Western which won him his second Academy Award
                    for Best Original Screenplay. His eighth film, The Hateful Eight (2015), was a revisionist Western
                    thriller and opened to audiences with a roadshow release. Tarantino's most recent film, Once Upon a
                    Time in Hollywood (2019), was a comedy-drama set in the
                    late 1960s about the transition of Old Hollywood to New Hollywood; his debut novel, a novelization
                    of the film, was published in 2021. He has said that, though it is not definite, his current plan is
                    for his next film to be his last before he retires.</p>

                <h2 id="h2-1">Career</h2>
                <p>Through the 1980s, Tarantino had a number of jobs. After lying about his age, he worked as an usher
                    at an adult movie theater in Torrance, called the Pussycat Theater. He spent time as a recruiter in
                    the aerospace industry, and for five years he worked at Video Archives, a video store in Manhattan
                    Beach, California.[14][15] He was well known in the local community for his film knowledge and video
                    recommendations; Tarantino stated, "When people ask me if I went to film school, I tell them, 'No, I
                    went to films."[16][a] In 1986, Tarantino was employed in his first Hollywood job, working with
                    Video Archives colleague Roger Avary, as production assistants on Dolph Lundgren's exercise video,
                    Maximum Potential. Before working at Video Archives, Tarantino co-wrote Love Birds In Bondage with
                    Scott Magill.
                    Tarantino would go on to produce and direct the short film. Magill committed suicide in 1987, after
                    which all film shot was destroyed.[18] Later, Tarantino attended acting classes at the James Best
                    Theatre Company, where he met several of his eventual collaborators for his next film.[19][20][b] In
                    1987, Tarantino co-wrote and directed My Best Friend's Birthday (1987). It was left uncompleted, but
                    some of its dialogue was included in True Romance. The following year, he played an Elvis
                    impersonator in "Sophia's Wedding: Part 1", an episode in the
                    fourth season of The Golden Girls, which was broadcast on November 19, 1988.[24] Tarantino recalled
                    that the pay he received for the part helped support him during the preproduction of Reservoir Dogs;
                    he estimated he was initially paid about $650 but went on to receive about $3,000 in residuals over
                    three years because the episode was frequently rerun due to it being on a "best of..." lineup.</p>
