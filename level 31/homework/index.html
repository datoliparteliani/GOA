                <p>Clinton Eastwood Jr. (born May 31, 1930) is an American actor and film director. After achieving
                    success
                    in the Western TV series Rawhide, Eastwood rose to international fame with his role as the "Man with
                    No
                    Name" in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of spaghetti Westerns during the mid-1960s and as antihero
                    cop
                    Harry Callahan in the five Dirty Harry films throughout the 1970s and 1980s. These roles, among
                    others,
                    have made Eastwood an enduring cultural icon of masculinity.[4][5] Elected in 1986, Eastwood served
                    for
                    two years as the mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California. Eastwood's greatest commercial successes
                    are
                    the adventure comedy Every Which Way but Loose (1978) and
                    its action comedy sequel Any Which Way You Can (1980).[6] Other popular Eastwood films include the
                    Westerns Hang 'Em High (1968), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and Pale Rider (1985), the action-war
                    film
                    Where Eagles Dare (1968), the prison film Escape from Alcatraz (1979), the war film Heartbreak Ridge
                    (1986), the action film In the Line of Fire (1993), and the romantic drama The Bridges of Madison
                    County
                    (1995). More recent works include Gran Torino (2008), The Mule (2018), and Cry Macho (2021). Since
                    1967,
                    Eastwood's company Malpaso Productions has produced all but four of his American films. An Academy
                    Award
                    nominee for Best Actor, Eastwood won Best Director and Best Picture for his Western
                    film Unforgiven (1992) and his sports drama Million Dollar Baby (2004). In addition to directing
                    many of
                    his own star vehicles, Eastwood has directed films in which he did not appear, such as the mystery
                    drama
                    Mystic River (2003) and the war film Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), for which he received Academy
                    Award
                    nominations. He also directed the biographical films Changeling (2008), Invictus (2009), American
                    Sniper
                    (2014), Sully (2016), and Richard Jewell (2019). Eastwood's accolades include four Academy Awards,
                    four
                    Golden Globe Awards, three César Awards, and an
                    AFI Life Achievement Award. In 2000, he received the Italian Venice Film Festival's Golden Lion
                    award,
                    honoring his lifetime achievements. Bestowed two of France's highest civilian honors, he received
                    the
                    Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1994, and the Legion of Honour in 2007.</p>

                <h2 id="h2-1">Career</h2>
                <p>According to a CBS press release for Rawhide, Universal-International's camera crew was shooting in
                    Fort
                    Ord when an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director,[34]
                    although
                    this is disputed by Eastwood's unauthorized biographer, Patrick McGilligan.[35] According to
                    Eastwood's
                    official biography, the key figure was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had
                    contacts in Hollywood.[34] While in Los Angeles, Hill became reacquainted with Eastwood and managed
                    to
                    sneak him into a Universal studio, where he introduced him to cameraman Irving Glassberg.[34]
                    Glassberg
                    arranged for an audition under Arthur Lubin, who, although very impressed with Eastwood's appearance
                    and
                    stature (then 6 ft 4 in [193 cm]), disapproved of his acting, remarking, "He was quite amateurish.
                    He
                    didn't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything."[36] Lubin suggested that he attend
                    drama classes and arranged for Eastwood's initial contract in April 1954, at $100 per week.[36]
                    After
                    signing, Eastwood was initially criticized for his stiff manner and delivering his lines through his
                    teeth, a lifelong trademark.[37] In May 1954, Eastwood made his first real audition for Six Bridges
                    to
                    Cross, but was rejected by Joseph
                    Pevney.[38] After many unsuccessful auditions, he was eventually given a minor role by director Jack
                    Arnold in Revenge of the Creature (1955), a sequel to the recently released Creature from the Black
                    Lagoon.[39] In September 1954, Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin's Lady Godiva of
                    Coventry, won a role in February 1955, playing "Jonesy", a sailor in Francis in the Navy and
                    appeared
                    uncredited in another Jack Arnold film, Tarantula, where he played a squadron pilot.[40][41] In May
                    1955, Eastwood put four hours' work into the film Never Say Goodbye and had a minor uncredited role
                    as a
                    ranch hand (his first western film) in August 1955 with Law Man, also known as Star in the Dust,
                    starring John Agar and Mamie Van Doren.[42] Universal presented him with his first television role
                    on
                    July 2, 1955, on NBC's Allen in Movieland, which starred comedian Steve Allen, actor Tony Curtis,
                    and
                    swing musician Benny Goodman.[43] Although he continued to develop as an actor, Universal terminated
                    his
                    contract on October 23, 1955.[44] Eastwood joined the Marsh Agency, and although Lubin landed him
                    his
                    biggest role to date in The First
                    Traveling Saleslady (1956) and later hired him for Escapade in Japan (1957), without a formal
                    contract,
                    Eastwood was struggling.[45] On his financial advisor Irving Leonard's advice, he switched to the
                    Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed several small roles in 1956 as a
                    temperamental army officer for a segment of ABC's Reader's Digest series, and as a motorcycle gang
                    member on a Highway Patrol episode.[45] In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet in West Point series and a
                    suicidal gold prospector on Death Valley Days. In 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of
                    Navy
                    Log and in early 1959 made a notable guest
                    appearance as Red Hardigan on Maverick opposite James Garner as a cowardly villain intent on
                    marrying a
                    rich girl for money.[46] Eastwood had a small part as an aviator in Lafayette Escadrille (1958) and
                    played a major role as an ex-renegade of the Confederacy in Ambush at Cimarron Pass (also 1958): a
                    film
                    that Eastwood considers the low point of his career.</p>
