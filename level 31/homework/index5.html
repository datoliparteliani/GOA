                <p>Steven Allan Spielberg (/ˈspiːlbɜːrɡ/; born December 18, 1946) is an American filmmaker. A major
                    figure of the New Hollywood era and pioneer of the modern blockbuster, Spielberg is widely regarded
                    as one of the greatest film directors of all time and is the most commercially successful director
                    in film history.[1] He is the recipient of many accolades, including three Academy Awards, two BAFTA
                    Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards as well as the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1995, the Knight
                    Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 2001, the Kennedy Center Honor in
                    2006, the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2009 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015. Seven of his
                    films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as "culturally,
                    historically or aesthetically significant". Spielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in
                    Phoenix, Arizona.[4] He moved to California
                    and studied film in college. After directing several episodes for television, including Night
                    Gallery and Columbo, he directed the television film Duel (1971), his first full-length film which
                    later received an international theatrical release. He made his theatrical debut with The Sugarland
                    Express (1974) and became a household name with the summer blockbuster Jaws (1975). He directed more
                    escapist box office successes with Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), E.T. the
                    Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and the original Indiana Jones trilogy (1981–89). He explored drama in The
                    Color Purple (1985) and Empire of the Sun (1987). In 1993, Spielberg directed back-to-back
                    blockbuster hits with the science fiction thriller Jurassic
                    Park, the highest-grossing film ever at the time, and the Holocaust drama Schindler's List, which
                    has often been listed as one of the greatest films ever made. He won the Academy Award for Best
                    Director for the latter and the World War II epic Saving Private Ryan (1998). Spielberg has since
                    directed the science fiction films A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), Minority Report (2002), and
                    War of the Worlds (2005); the historical dramas Amistad (1997), Munich (2005), War Horse (2011),
                    Lincoln (2012), Bridge of Spies (2015) and The Post (2017); the comedy The Terminal (2004); the
                    animated film The Adventures of Tintin (2011); the musical West Side Story (2021); and the
                    semi-autobiographical drama The Fabelmans (2022). Spielberg co-founded Amblin Entertainment and
                    DreamWorks, and he has served as a producer for many
                    successful films and television series, among them Poltergeist (1982), Gremlins (1984), Back to the
                    Future (1985), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and Band of Brothers (2001). He has had a long
                    collaboration with the composer John Williams, with whom he has worked for all but five of his
                    feature films.[5][6] Several of Spielberg's works are considered among the greatest films in
                    history, and some are among the highest-grossing films ever.[7] In 2013, Time listed him as one of
                    the 100 most influential people,[8] and in 2023, Spielberg was the recipient of the first ever Time
                    100 Impact Award in the US.</p>

                <h2 id="h2-1">Career</h2>
                <p>Spielberg made his professional debut with "Eyes", a segment of Night Gallery (1969) scripted by Rod
                    Serling and starring Joan Crawford.[67] Initially, there was skepticism from Crawford and studio
                    executives regarding Spielberg's inexperience. Despite Spielberg's efforts to implement advanced
                    camerawork techniques, studio executives demanded a more straightforward approach. His initial
                    contributions received mixed responses, leading Spielberg to briefly step back from studio work.[68]
                    Crawford, reflecting on her collaboration with Spielberg, recognized his potential, noting his
                    unique intuitive inspiration. She expressed her appreciation for Spielberg's talent in a note to him
                    and also communicated her approval to Serling. Crawford's endorsement highlighted Spielberg's early
                    recognition in Hollywood despite initial hesitations regarding his experience. In the early 1970s,
                    Spielberg unsuccessfully tried to raise financing for his own low-budget films.
                    He co-wrote and directed teleplays for Marcus Welby, M.D., The Name of the Game, Columbo, Owen
                    Marshall, Counselor at Law and The Psychiatrist.[70] Although unsatisfied with his work,[71]
                    Spielberg used the opportunity to experiment with his techniques and learn about filmmaking. He
                    earned good reviews and impressed producers; he was earning a steady income and relocated to Laurel
                    Canyon, Los Angeles. Impressed, Universal signed Spielberg to do four television films.[72] The
                    first was Duel (1971),
                    adapted from Richard Matheson's short story of the same name, about a salesman (Dennis Weaver) being
                    chased down a highway by a psychotic tanker truck driver.[73] Impressed, executives decided to
                    promote the film on television. Reviews were positive, and Universal asked Spielberg to shoot more
                    scenes so that Duel could be released to international markets.[74] "Deservedly so" writes David
                    Thomson, "for it stands up as one of the medium's most compelling spirals of suspense. The
                    ordinariness of the Dennis Weaver character and the monstrous malignance of the truck confront one
                    another with a narrative assurance that never needs to remind us of the element of fable."[75] More
                    TV films followed: Something Evil (1972) and Savage (1973). Spielberg made his theatrical debut with
                    The Sugarland Express (1974), based on a true story about a
                    married couple on the run, desperate to regain custody of their baby from foster parents.[76] The
                    film starred Goldie Hawn and William Atherton and marked the first of many collaborations with the
                    composer John Williams.[77] Although the film was awarded Best Screenplay at the 1974 Cannes Film
                    Festival, it was not a commercial success,[78] which Spielberg blamed on Universal's inconsistent
                    marketing.[79] The film opened in four hundred theaters in the US to positive reviews; Pauline Kael
                    wrote "Spielberg uses his gifts in a very free-and-easy, American way—for humor, and for a physical
                    response to action. He could be that rarity among directors, a born entertainer—perhaps a new
                    generation's Howard Hawks."[80] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that "a major new director is on the
                    horizon.</p>
