                <p>Gregor Justin "Gore" Verbinski (born March 16, 1964) is an American film director, screenwriter, and
                    producer. He is best known for directing Mouse Hunt, The Ring, the first three Pirates of the
                    Caribbean films, and Rango. For his work on Rango, Verbinski won both the Academy Award and BAFTA
                    Award for Best Animated Film. Verbinski was born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the fourth of five
                    children of Laurette Ann (née McGovern) and Victor Vincent Verbinski, a nuclear physicist.[1][2] His
                    father was of Polish descent. He attended La Jolla High School before enrolling at the University of
                    California, Los Angeles
                    (UCLA), where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in cinematography. In his youth, Verbinski was
                    passionate about music and played in several punk rock bands, which influenced his creative
                    approach.</p>

                <h2 id="h2-1">Career</h2>
                <p>His first films were a series of 8 mm films called The Driver Files c. 1979, when he was a young
                    teen. After graduating from film school at UCLA, he got his first job as a script reader at the
                    commercial production company Limelight in 1987. After director Julien Temple viewed some of his
                    work, he signed to his production company Nitrate Films, and later Palomar Pictures,[5] where he
                    directed music videos for bands like Vicious Rumors, Bad Religion, NOFX, 24-7 Spyz and Monster
                    Magnet. Verbinski moved from music videos to commercials, where he worked for many brand names
                    including Nike, Coca-Cola, Canon, Skittles and United Airlines. One of his most famous commercials
                    was for Budweiser, featuring frogs who croak the brand name. For his efforts in commercials,
                    Verbinski won four Clio Awards and one Cannes Advertising Silver Lion. After completing a short
                    film, The Ritual (which he both wrote and directed), Verbinski made his
                    feature film directing debut in 1997 with Mouse Hunt, which became a global hit. Following that
                    film's success, Verbinski planned and developed several aborted projects; The Sky Is Falling,[6]
                    Mission to Mars,[7] Where the Wild Things Are,[8] The Big Ticket,[9] The Light Princess[10] and an
                    unpublished manuscript by William Monahan titled The Lighthouse.[11] Verbinski returned in 2001 with
                    the action/comedy The Mexican, starring Julia Roberts and Brad Pitt.
                    The film received mixed reviews, and performed modestly at the box-office, earning $68 million
                    domestically which was quite meager considering its star power (it was technically successful due to
                    its moderately low $38 million budget). Verbinski followed it up with the horror film remake The
                    Ring (2002), which struck gold globally, grossing well over $200 million worldwide. Verbinski also
                    had a directorial hand in The Time Machine that year, temporarily taking over for an exhausted Simon
                    Wells.[12] Verbinski directed some of the underground Morlock sequences[citation needed] and is
                    given a "Thanks to" credit in the film. He then directed the very successful Pirates of the
                    Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl which
                    earned over $600 million at the international box office. This was his first collaboration with
                    producer Jerry Bruckheimer, whom he has since collaborated with on several other movies. His next
                    film was The Weather Man, which starred Nicolas Cage. The film received mixed to positive reviews
                    but was a box office failure. In March 2005, he started filming the sequels Pirates of the
                    Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The former then became his
                    biggest success so far, becoming the third film ever to gross over $1 billion at the international
                    box office. In 2008, Verbinski's Blind Wink production company signed a deal with Universal.[13]
                    Verbinski was also set to direct a film for Universal based on the video game BioShock.[14] However,
                    budgetary and creative disputes stemming from Verbinski's wish to incorporate a functioning
                    underwater rail transport system, driven by his noted fascination with trains, derailed development.
                    Verbinski was then replaced by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo as director and the film was subsequently
                    cancelled.[15] In 2011 and 2013, Verbinski would delve into the Western genre, with decidedly
                    different results:
                    Rango was well received, critically and commercially, and earned the Academy Award for Best Animated
                    Feature. However, his adaptation of the 1930s radio hero, The Lone Ranger for Disney, was not, the
                    project having been stuck in development hell for several years, undergone rewrites and budget
                    cuts,[16][17] and gained controversy for the casting of Johnny Depp as the Native American Tonto.
                    The film grossed $260 million against a $215–225 million budget, plus an estimated $150–160 million
                    marketing campaign.[16] That same year, he was also the executive producer of the Ben Stiller
                    adaptation of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, after having initially been attached in 2010 to
                    direct the film himself.[18] In 2012, Verbinski announced three films in development at Blind Wink;
                    the Western Bitterroot, the
                    sci-fi film Spaceless, and a live action film based on the board game Clue. At various points, he
                    was attached to direct all three films, before eventually opting to produce instead.[19] In 2016,
                    Verbinski's horror film A Cure for Wellness starring Dane DeHaan and Mia Goth premiered at
                    the Alamo Drafthouse before receiving a wide release in 2017.[20] It received mediocre reviews from
                    critics and was a financial bomb, grossing $26.6 million against a $40 million budget.[21] Verbinski
                    was set to next direct a film centering around the character Gambit, within the X-Men film universe,
                    before dropping out of the project in January 2018.[22] In the 2020s, he was seeking financial
                    backing for Cattywumpus, an animated feature about cats in
                    outer space, after being in the works at Netflix.</p>
