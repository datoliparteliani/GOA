                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Star Wars is an American epic space opera media franchise created by George Lucas, which began with
                    the eponymous 1977 film[a] and quickly became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. The franchise has
                    been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels,
                    comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional
                    universe.[b] Star Wars is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. The original
                    1977 film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope, was followed by the sequels
                    Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the Jedi (1983), forming the
                    original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to write and direct a prequel
                    trilogy, consisting of Episode I: The Phantom Menace (1999), Episode II: Attack of the Clones
                    (2002), and Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to
                    Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of
                    Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015), Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise
                    of Skywalker (2019). The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters "a long time ago
                    in a galaxy far, far away"[2] across multiple fictional eras, in which humans and many species of
                    aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with droids, which may be programmed for personal assistance or
                    battle.[3] Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology.[4][5][6]
                    The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive
                    tribes. Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a Star
                    Wars planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life.[7] The franchise
                    also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae.[8][9] Spacecraft
                    range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space
                    stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars.[10][11][12] Telecommunication includes two-way audio
                    and audiovisual screens, holographic projections, and hyperspace transmission.[13] The universe of
                    Star Wars is generally similar to the real universe but its laws of physics are less
                    strict allowing for more imaginative stories.[14] One result of that is a mystical power known as
                    the Force which is described in the original film as "an energy field created by all living things
                    ... [that] binds the galaxy together".[15] The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god.[16]
                    Through training and meditation, those whom "the Force is strong with" exhibit various superpowers
                    (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy);[17] it is
                    believed nothing is impossible for the Force.[18] These superpowers are wielded by two major
                    knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act
                    on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the
                    dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.[19][20] While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark
                    Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths') are intended to be limited to two: a master and their
                    apprentice.[21] The franchise is set against a backdrop of galactic conflict involving republics and
                    empires, such
                    as the evil Galactic Empire.[22] The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called the lightsaber,
                    a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts.[23] The rest
                    of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster firearms.[24] In
                    the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant.[25] Bounty
                    hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments, while illicit activities include
                    smuggling and slavery.</p>

                <h2>Cultural impact</h2>
                <p>The Star Wars saga has had a significant impact on popular culture,[277] with references to its
                    fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life.[278] Phrases like "evil empire" and "May the
                    Force be with you" have become part of the popular lexicon.[279] The first Star Wars film in 1977
                    was a cultural unifier,[280] enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people.[281] The film can be said to have
                    helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction
                    films a mainstream genre.[282] The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and
                    homages, with popular examples including Hardware Wars, Spaceballs, The Family Guy Trilogy and Robot
                    Chicken: Star Wars. In 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original Star Wars film for
                    preservation in the U.S.
                    National Film Registry, as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."[283] The
                    Empire Strikes Back was selected in 2010,[284][285] and Return of the Jedi was selected in
                    2021.[286] 35 mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for
                    preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints,[287][288] but it
                    was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical
                    releases. The original Star Wars film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for
                    reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film's release, the studio's stock price
                    doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37
                    million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million.[269] The
                    franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media
                    conglomerate.[290] With over $10.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts, Star Wars is the
                    second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time. Star Wars fundamentally changed the aesthetics
                    and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the
                    focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and
                    irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film
                    industry in fundamental ways. Before Star Wars, special effects in films had not appreciably
                    advanced since the 1950s.[293] The commercial success of Star Wars created a boom in
                    state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s.[290] Along with Jaws, Star Wars started the
                    tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many
                    screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important.[294][281] It created the model for
                    the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than
                    the film itself did. Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book The Great Movies, "Like The Birth of
                    a Nation and Citizen
                    Kane, Star Wars was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after." It
                    began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the
                    first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build
                    upon.[295] Finally, along with Steven Spielberg's Jaws, it shifted the film industry's focus away
                    from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger
                    audiences. Some critics have blamed Star Wars and Jaws for "ruining" Hollywood by shifting its focus
                    from
                    "sophisticated" films such as The Godfather, Taxi Driver, and Annie Hall to films about spectacle
                    and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards
                    blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels.[298] One such critic, Peter Biskind,
                    complained, "When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown
                    sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s
                    Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass."[298][299] In an opposing
                    view, Tom Shone wrote that through Star Wars and Jaws, Lucas and Spielberg "didn't betray cinema at
                    all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a
                    magic act, one big special effect", which was "a kind of rebirth". The original Star Wars trilogy is
                    widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history.[300]
                    Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by Star Wars, including Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Roland
                    Emmerich, John Lasseter,[301] David Fincher, Joss Whedon, John Singleton, Kevin Smith,[295] and
                    later Star Wars directors J. J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards.[302] Lucas's concept of a "used universe"
                    particularly influenced Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) and Alien (1979), James Cameron's Aliens
                    (1986) as well as The Terminator (1984), George Miller's Mad Max 2 (1981), and Peter Jackson's The
                    Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001–2003).[295] Christopher Nolan cited Star Wars as an influence when
                    making the 2010 blockbuster film Inception.</p>
