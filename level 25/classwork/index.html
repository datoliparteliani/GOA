            <h1>Squirrels</h1>
            <p class="p1">Squirrels are members of the family Sciuridae (/sɪˈjuːrɪdeɪ, -diː/), a family that includes
                small
                or
                medium-sized rodents. The squirrel family includes tree squirrels, ground squirrels (including chipmunks
                and
                prairie dogs, among others), and flying squirrels. Squirrels are indigenous to the Americas, Eurasia,
                and
                Africa, and were introduced by humans to Australia.[1] The earliest known fossilized squirrels date from
                the
                Eocene epoch, and among other living rodent families, the squirrels are most closely related to the
                mountain
                beaver and dormice.[2]</p>

            <p class="p2">The word squirrel, first attested in 1327, comes from the Anglo-Norman esquirel which is from
                the
                Old French escurel, the reflex of a Latin word sciurus, which was taken from the Ancient Greek word
                σκίουρος
                (skiouros; from σκία-ουρος) 'shadow-tailed', referring to the long bushy tail which many of its members
                have.[3][4] Sciurus is also the name of one of its genuses.[4] The native Old English word for the
                squirrel,
                ācweorna, only survived into Middle English (as aquerne)
                before being replaced.[5] The Old English word is of Common Germanic origin, cognates of which are still
                used in other Germanic languages, including the German Eichhörnchen (diminutive of Eichhorn, which is
                not as
                frequently used); the Norwegian ikorn/ekorn; the Dutch eekhoorn; the Swedish ekorre and the Danish
                egern.

            <p class="p3">Squirrels live in almost every habitat, from tropical rainforest to semiarid desert, avoiding
                only
                the high polar regions and the driest of deserts. They are predominantly herbivorous, subsisting on
                seeds
                and nuts, but many will eat insects and even small vertebrates.[21] Many juvenile squirrels die in the
                first
                year of life. Adult squirrels can have a lifespan of 5 to 10 years
                in the wild. Some can survive 10 to 20 years in captivity.[22] Premature death may occur when a nest
                falls
                from the tree, in which case the mother may abandon her young if their body temperature is not correct.
                Many
                such baby squirrels have been rescued and fostered by a professional wildlife rehabilitator until they
                could
                be safely returned to the wild,[23] although the density of squirrel populations in many places and the
                constant care required by premature squirrels means that few rehabilitators are willing to spend their
                time
                doing this and such animals are routinely euthanized instead.</p>
