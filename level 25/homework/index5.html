            <p class="p1">Well, Just You Wait! (Russian: Ну, погоди!, romanized: Nu, pogodi!, Russian pronunciation:
                [nʊpəgɐˈdʲi]) Also known as I'll get you![2] in official translations, is a Soviet, later Russian,
                series of animated short films produced by Soyuzmultfilm. In the 2014 all-Russian poll, Well, Just You
                Wait! won by a wide margin as people's favourite cartoon/animated series of all time. The series follows
                the comical adventures of Wolf (Волк), trying to catch – and presumably eat – Hare
                (Заяц). It features additional characters that usually either help the hare or interfere with the Wolf's
                plans. The original film language is Russian, but very little speech is used, usually interjections or
                at most several sentences per episode. The series' most common line is the eponymous "Nu, pogodi!",
                yelled by the wolf when his plans fail. It also includes many grunts, laughs, and songs.</p>

            <p class="p2">The original script for Nu, pogodi! was created for the animation studio Soyuzmultfilm in
                Moscow by the writers Felix Kandel, Arkady Khait, and Aleksandr Kurlyandsky, whose works included
                humourist and satirical writings.[5] Most directors of Soyuzmultfilm rejected the script, but Vyacheslav
                Kotyonochkin was convinced by the idea.[6] However, Gennady Sokolsky was the first person to direct the
                cartoon, more specifically a pilot of it, which was given the name Nu, pogodi! A two and a half-minute
                short film with character designs very different from the later series was created, but it already
                featured the Wolf's titular catchphrase. It was shown as part of the first episode of the animation
                magazine Happy Merry-Go-Round in 1969.[7][8] Kotyonochkin wanted the Wolf to be voiced by the actor and
                singer Vladimir Vysotsky, but was not given
                permission by the officials. The actor Anatoli Papanov was approved instead. Actress Klara Rumyanova,
                who commonly voiced cute and small characters, received the role of the Hare.[9] Svetozar Rusakov was
                responsible for the visual design of the series, including its characters.[10][11] In case of the music,
                the majority of the soundtrack throughout the series during Soviet times was edited directly from
                existing international records, though there were also original compositions.[12] The first episode
                aired in 1969.[13] Nu, pogodi! was not intended to become a long-running series, but
                the cartoon reached immense popularity and Soyuzmultfilm received many letters from viewers asking for
                more adventures of Wolf and Hare.[14][15] Therefore, production of new shorts continued into the 1980s.
                However, it was temporarily halted for political reasons after the seventh episode in 1973, as script
                writer Felix Kandel and his family wanted to emigrate to Israel, but were denied by the Soviet
                authorities.[5] Nonetheless, production soon resumed, though without Kandel, as Nu, pogodi! viewers were
                among the highest party leadership. Episode 16, the last film created during the Soviet era, aired in
                1986.[13] The series was put on hold
                after the death of Anatoli Papanov in 1987.</p>
