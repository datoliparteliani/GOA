            <h1 class="h1-1">Linux</h1>
            <p class="p1">Linux (/ˈlɪnʊks/, LIN-uuks)[15] is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based
                on the Linux kernel,[16] an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus
                Torvalds.[17][18][19] Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the
                kernel and supporting system software and libraries — many of which are provided by the GNU Project — to
                create a complete operating system. Many Linux distributions use the word "Linux" in their name, but the
                Free Software Foundation uses and
                recommends the name "GNU/Linux" to emphasize the use and importance of GNU software in many
                distributions, causing some controversy.[20][21] Thousands of distributions exist, many based directly
                or indirectly on other distributions;[22][23] popular Linux distributions[24][25][26] include Debian,
                Fedora Linux, Arch Linux, and Ubuntu, while commercial distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux
                and SUSE Linux Enterprise. Other than the Linux kernel, key components that make up a distribution may
                include a display server (windowing system), a package manager, a bootloader and the Bash shell. Linux
                is one of the most prominent examples of free and open-source software collaboration. While
                originally developed for x86 based personal computers, it has since been ported to more platforms than
                any other operating system,[27] and is used on a wide variety of devices including PCs, workstations,
                mainframes and embedded systems. Linux is the predominant operating system for servers and is also used
                on all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers.[g] When combined with Android, which is Linux-based
                and designed for smartphones, they have the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating
                systems.</p>

            <p class="p2">While attending the University of Helsinki in the fall of 1990, Torvalds enrolled in a Unix
                course.[62] The course used a MicroVAX minicomputer running Ultrix, and one of the required texts was
                Operating Systems: Design and Implementation by Andrew S. Tanenbaum. This textbook included a copy of
                Tanenbaum's Minix operating system. It was with this course that Torvalds first became exposed to Unix.
                In 1991, he became curious about operating systems.[63] Frustrated by the licensing of Minix, which at
                the time limited it to educational use only,[60] he began to work on his operating system kernel, which
                eventually became the Linux kernel. On July 3, 1991, to implement Unix system calls, Linus Torvalds
                attempted unsuccessfully to obtain a
                digital copy of the POSIX standards documentation with a request to the comp.os.minix newsgroup.[64]
                After not finding the POSIX documentation, Torvalds initially resorted to determining system calls from
                SunOS documentation owned by the university for use in operating its Sun Microsystems server. He also
                learned some system calls from Tanenbaum's Minix text. Torvalds began the development of the Linux
                kernel on Minix and applications written for Minix were also
                used on Linux. Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development took place on Linux
                systems.[65] GNU applications also replaced all Minix components, because it was advantageous to use the
                freely available code from the GNU Project with the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the
                GNU GPL can be reused in other computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a
                compatible license. Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which prohibited commercial
                redistribution, to the GNU GPL.[66] Developers worked to integrate GNU components with the Linux kernel,
                creating a fully functional and free operating system.</p>
