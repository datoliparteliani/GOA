            <p class="p1">Masha and the Bear (Russian: Ма́ша и Медве́дь, romanized: Másha i Medvéd', pronounced [ˈmaʂə ɪ
                mʲɪdˈvʲetʲ]) is a Russian preschool comedy animated television series created by Oleg Kuzovkov and
                produced by Animaccord Animation Studio, loosely based on the oral children's folk story of the same
                name. The series focuses on the adventures of a very young girl named Masha and a bear (whom she dubs
                "Mishka"), her caring friend who always keeps her safe from disasters. Masha and The Bear is the most
                watched preschool series in the world, with 36 times more requests than
                the average. It is also the fifth most-watched youth series (0–18) worldwide, just ahead of Peppa
                Pig.[1][better source needed] Many of the episodes have been successful on YouTube. In particular, the
                original Russian-language
                version of the episode "Recipe for Disaster" (Russian: Маша плюс каша, romanized: Masha plyus kasha) has
                almost 4.5 billion views as of April 2022, making it the site's fourteenth most viewed video of all
                time, and the most viewed video on YouTube that is not a music video.[2] The show was first launched on
                January 7, 2009, and it was the first Russian-produced animated TV show
                to be released in 4K.[citation needed] The show provides the basis for the Masha and The Bear Land of
                Laughter, an area with attractions aimed
                at younger children at the theme park Land of Legends, near Antalya, Turkey.</p>

            <p class="p2">Masha is a four-year-old girl who lives in the forest with her pig, goat, and dog. In the
                first episode, it is shown that all the animals in the forest are afraid of her, as she is constantly
                forcing them to play with her. Then Masha sees a butterfly and inadvertently follows it inside the home
                of the Bear, who has gone fishing. While playing there, she makes a big mess. When he returns, he sees
                the disaster caused by Masha. The Bear tries to get rid of Masha but after multiple failed attempts, the
                unlikely duo become friends. In each episode of the show, Masha is portrayed as a bright little girl who
                loves exploring the world
                around her. Masha's shenanigans result in unexpected but entertaining situations that are at the heart
                of the show's episodes. The kind-hearted Bear is always trying to keep Masha out of trouble. There are
                several supporting characters in the series, including Masha's cousin Dasha, a penguin adopted by the
                Bear, a young panda cub from China (the Bear's cousin), two wolves who live in an old UAZ ambulance, a
                tiger that used to work with the Bear in the circus, and a Female Bear that is the object of the Bear's
                affections. Characters also include a hare, squirrels and hedgehogs, a pig called Rosie, a goat, and a
                dog who all live in Masha's front yard.</p>
