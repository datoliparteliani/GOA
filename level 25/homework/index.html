            <h1 class="h1-1">Snowy owl</h1>
            <p class="p1">The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus),[4] also known as the polar owl, the white owl and the Arctic
                owl,[5] is a
                large, white owl of the true owl family.[6] Snowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of both North
                America and the Palearctic, breeding mostly on the tundra.[2] It has a number of unique adaptations to
                its
                habitat and lifestyle, which are quite distinct from other extant owls.[7] One of the largest species of
                owl, it is the only owl with mainly white plumage.[6] Males tend to be a purer white overall while
                females
                tend to have more extensive flecks of dark brown.[8] Juvenile male snowy owls have dark markings that
                may
                appear similar to females until maturity, at which point they typically turn whiter. The composition of
                brown markings about the wing, although not foolproof, is the most reliable technique to age and sex
                individual snowy owls. Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is often
                active
                during the day,
                especially in the summertime.[7] The snowy owl is both a specialized and generalist hunter. Its breeding
                efforts and global population are closely tied to the availability of tundra-dwelling lemmings, but in
                the
                non-breeding season, and occasionally during breeding, the snowy owl can adapt to almost any available
                prey
                â€“ most often other small mammals and northerly water birds, as well as, opportunistically,
                carrion.[5][8]
                Snowy owls typically nest on a small rise on the ground of the tundra.[10] The snowy owl lays a very
                large
                clutch of eggs, often from about 5 to 11, with the laying and hatching of eggs considerably
                staggered.[8]
                Despite the short Arctic summer, the development of the young takes a relatively long time and
                independence
                is sought in autumn.[7] The snowy owl is a nomadic bird, rarely breeding at the same locations or with
                the
                same mates on an annual
                basis and often not breeding at all if prey is unavailable.[8] A largely migratory bird, snowy owls can
                wander almost anywhere close to the Arctic, sometimes unpredictably irrupting to the south in large
                numbers.[8][11] Given the difficulty of surveying such an unpredictable bird, there was little in-depth
                knowledge historically about the snowy owl's status. However, recent data suggests the species is
                declining
                precipitously.[2][12] Whereas the global population was once estimated at over 200,000 individuals,
                recent
                data suggests that there are probably fewer than 100,000 individuals globally and that the number of
                successful breeding pairs is 28,000 or even considerably less.[2][13] While the causes are not well
                understood, numerous, complex environmental factors often correlated with global warming are probably at
                the
                forefront of the fragility of the snowy owl's existence.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-1">Taxonomy</h2>
            <p class="p2">The snowy owl was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his
                landmark 1758
                10th edition of Systema Naturae, where it was given the binomial name Strix scandiaca.[14] The genus
                name
                Bubo is Latin for "horned owl" and scandiacus is Neo-Latin for "of Scandinavia".[15] The former generic
                name
                Nyctea is derived from Greek meaning "night".[5] Linnaeus originally described the different plumages of
                this owl as separate species, with the male specimens of snowy owls being considered Strix scandiaca and
                the
                likely females considered as Strix nyctea.[5][16] Until recently, the snowy owl was regarded as the sole
                member of a distinct genus, as Nyctea scandiaca, but mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data shows that it is
                very
                closely related to the horned owls in the genus Bubo and the species is now thusly often considered
                inclusive with that genus.[17][18] However, some authorities debate this classification, still
                preferring
                Nyctea. Often authorities are motivated to retain the separate genus on the grounds of osteological
                distinctions. Genetic testing revealed a reasonably distinct genetic makeup for snowy owls, being about
                8%
                genetically distinct from other Bubo owls, perhaps giving credence to those who count the species as
                separate under Nyctea.[5][20] However, a fairly recent shared origin in evolutionary history has been
                illustrated through a combination of genetic study and fossil review and there is little, other than
                osteology of the tarsometatarsus, to outright distinguish the snowy owl from other modern species like
                the
                Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).[5][7] Genetic testing has indicated that the snowy owl may have diverged
                from related species at around 4 million years ago.[5] Furthermore, it has determined that the living
                species genetically most closely related to the snowy owl is the great horned owl (Bubo
                virginianus).[5][21]
                On a broader scale, owls in general have, through genetic materials, been determined to be a highly
                distinct
                group, with outwardly similar groups such as Caprimulgiformes revealed to not be at all closely
                related.[22][23] Within the owl order, typical owls are highly divergent from barn-owls.[6][21]
                Furthermore,
                the Bubo genus likely clustered at some point during the evolutionary process with other largish owls,
                such
                as Strix, Pulsatrix and Ciccaba, based on broad similarities in their voice, reproductive behaviors
                (i.e.
                hooting postures) and a similar number and structure of chromosomes and autosomes.[6][24] A number, but
                not
                all, of extant typical owls seem to have evolved from an ancient shared common ancestor with the Bubo
                owls.[25] In addition to the question of relationship of the traditional Bubo owls to the snowy owls,
                ongoing ambiguity of the relationship of other similarly large-sized owls has been persistent. These
                have
                sometimes either been included in the genus or within separate genera, i.e. the Ketupu or fish owls and
                the
                Scotopelia or fishing owls. Despite the adaptive distinctions, the grouping of these large owls (i.e.
                Bubo,
                snowy, fish and perhaps fishing owls) appears to be borne out via research of
                karyotypes.[6][25][21][26][27]
