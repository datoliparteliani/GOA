        <h1>Guinea Pig</h1>
        <p>The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as the cavy or domestic cavy (/ˈkeɪvi/
            KAY-vee), is a species of rodent belonging to the genus Cavia, family Caviidae. Breeders tend to use the
            name "cavy" for the animal, but "guinea pig" is more commonly used in scientific and laboratory contexts.[1]
            Despite their name, guinea pigs are not native to Guinea, nor are they closely related to pigs. Instead,
            they originated in the Andes region of South America, where wild guinea pigs can still be found today.[2]
            Studies based on biochemistry and DNA hybridization suggest they are domesticated animals that do not exist
            naturally in the wild, but are descendants of a closely related cavy species such as C. tschudii.[3][4]
            Originally, they were domesticated as livestock (source of meat) at the Andean region and are still consumed
            in some parts of the world. In Western society, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a pet
            since its introduction to Europe and North America by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile
            nature, friendly responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them have
            continued to make guinea pigs a popular choice of household pets. Consequently, organizations devoted to the
            competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide. Through artificial selection, many
            specialized breeds with varying coat colors and textures have been selected by breeders. Livestock breeds of
            guinea pig play an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean peoples, especially as a food
            source.[6] They are not only used in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies[7] but also raised
            for their meat. Guinea pigs are an important culinary staple in the Andes Mountains, where it is known as
            cuy. Lately, marketers tried to increase their consumption outside South America.[8] Biological
            experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were used
            so frequently as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries that the epithet guinea pig came into use to
            describe a human test subject. Since that time, they have mainly been replaced by other rodents, such as
            mice and rats. However, they are still used in research, primarily as models to study such human medical
            conditions as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy (like humans, they require dietary intake of vitamin
            C), and pregnancy complications.</p>
