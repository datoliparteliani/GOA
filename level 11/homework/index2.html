        <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing <u><b>basketball</b></u>, which keeps me active and lets me connect with my friends on the court. I love the thrill of the game and the teamwork involved. I also like <u><b>video games</b></u>, spending time exploring different virtual worlds and immersing myself in exciting storylines. Its a great way to unwind and challenge myself. When Im not playing sports or gaming, I love <u><b>going out with friends</b></u>, whether we're hanging out at the mall, watching movies, or just enjoying each otherâ€™s company. These activities are a big part of who I am, and I cherish the fun experiences we create together.</p>
