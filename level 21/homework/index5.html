                <h1 id="m">Franz Kafka</h1>
                <p>Franz Kafka[b] (3 July 1883 – 3 June 1924) was an Austrian-Czech[4] novelist and writer from Prague.
                    He is widely regarded as a major figure of 20th-century literature; he wrote in German. His work
                    fuses elements of realism and the fantastic.[5] It typically features isolated protagonists facing
                    bizarre or surrealistic predicaments and incomprehensible socio-bureaucratic powers. It has been
                    interpreted as exploring themes of alienation, existential anxiety, guilt, and absurdity.[6] His
                    best known works include the novella The Metamorphosis and the novels The Trial and The Castle. The
                    term Kafkaesque has entered English to describe absurd situations like those depicted in his
                    writing. Kafka was born into a middle-class German- and Yiddish-speaking Czech Jewish family in
                    Prague, the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which belonged to the Austrian part of the
                    Austro-Hungarian Empire (today the capital of the Czech Republic, also known as Czechia).[8][9] He
                    trained as a lawyer, and after completing his legal education was employed full-time, for a year
                    handling cases for the indigent in the city's Provincial and Criminal Courts by an insurance
                    company, then working for nine months for an Italian insurance company, and finally, starting in
                    1908, spending 14 years with the Austrian Imperial and Royal Workmen's Accident Institute for the
                    Kingdom of Bohemia and its successor under the Czechoslovak Republic, rising to the position of
                    chief legal secretary. Being employed full-time forced Kafka to relegate writing to his spare time.
                    Over the course of his life, Kafka wrote hundreds of letters to family and close friends, including
                    his father, with whom he had a strained and formal relationship. He became engaged to several women
                    but never married. He died in obscurity in 1924 at the age of 40 from tuberculosis. Kafka was a
                    prolific writer, spending most of his free time writing, often late into the night. He burned an
                    estimated 90 percent of his total work due to his persistent struggles with self-doubt. Much of the
                    remaining 10 percent is lost or otherwise unpublished. Few of Kafka's works were published during
                    his lifetime; although the story collections Contemplation and A Country Doctor, and individual
                    stories, such as his novella The Metamorphosis, were published in literary magazines, they received
                    little attention. In his will, Kafka instructed his close friend and literary executor Max Brod to
                    destroy his unfinished works, including his novels The Trial, The Castle, and Amerika, but Brod
                    ignored these instructions and had much of his work published. Kafka's writings became famous in
                    German-speaking countries after World War II, influencing German literature, and its influence
                    spread elsewhere in the world in the 1960s. It has also influenced artists, composers, and
                    philosophers.</p>
                <h2 class="h2">Early life</h2>
                <p>Kafka was born near the Old Town Square in Prague, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His
                    family were German-speaking middle-class Ashkenazi Jews. His father, Hermann Kafka (1854–1931), was
                    the fourth child of Jakob Kafka, a shochet or ritual slaughterer in Osek, a Czech village with a
                    large Jewish population located near Strakonice in southern Bohemia. Hermann brought the Kafka
                    family to Prague. After working as a travelling sales representative, he eventually became a fashion
                    retailer who employed up to 15 people and used the image of a jackdaw (kavka in Czech, pronounced
                    and colloquially written as kafka) as his business logo. Kafka's mother, Julie (1856–1934), was the
                    daughter of Jakob Löwy, a prosperous retail merchant in Poděbrady,[15] and was better educated than
                    her husband. Kafka's parents, from traditional Jewish society, spoke German replete with influences
                    from their native Yiddish; their children, raised in an acculturated environment, spoke Standard
                    German. Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest.[17] Franz's two brothers,
                    Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele ("Elli")
                    (1889–1942), Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1942) and Ottilie ("Ottla") (1892–1943). All three were
                    murdered in the Holocaust of World War II. Valli was deported to the Łódź Ghetto in occupied Poland
                    in 1942, but that is the last documentation of her; it is assumed she did not survive the war.
                    Ottilie was Kafka's favourite sister. Hermann is described by Kafka scholar and translator Stanley
                    Corngold as a "huge, selfish, overbearing businessman" and by Franz Kafka as "a true Kafka in
                    strength, health, appetite, loudness of voice, eloquence, self-satisfaction, worldly dominance,
                    endurance, presence of mind, knowledge of human nature, a certain way of doing things on a grand
                    scale, of course with all the defects and weaknesses that go with all these advantages and into
                    which your temperament and sometimes your hot temper drive you". On business days, both parents were
                    absent from the home, with Julie Kafka working as many as 12 hours each day helping to manage the
                    family business. Consequently, Kafka's childhood was somewhat lonely,[21] and the children were
                    reared largely by a series of governesses and servants. Kafka's troubled relationship with his
                    father is evident in his Brief an den Vater (Letter to His Father) of more than 100 pages, in which
                    he complains of being profoundly affected by his father's authoritarian and demanding character; his
                    mother, in contrast, was quiet and shy. The dominating figure of Kafka's father had a significant
                    influence on Kafka's writing. The Kafka family had a servant girl living with them in a cramped
                    apartment. Franz's room was often cold. In November 1913, the family moved into a bigger apartment,
                    although Ellie and Valli had married and moved out of the first apartment. In early August 1914,
                    just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and
                    moved back in with the family in this larger apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children.
                    Franz at age 31 moved into Valli's former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the
                    first time.</p>
