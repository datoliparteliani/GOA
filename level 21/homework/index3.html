                <h1 id="m">Flying Fish</h1>
                <p>The Exocoetidae are a family of marine ray-finned fish in the order Beloniformes, known colloquially
                    as flying fish or flying cod. About 64 species are grouped in seven genera. While they cannot fly in
                    the same way a bird does, flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of the water where
                    their long wing-like fins enable gliding for considerable distances above the water's surface. The
                    main reason for this behavior is thought to be to escape from underwater predators, which include
                    swordfish, mackerel, tuna, and marlin, among others, though their periods of flight expose them to
                    attack by avian predators such as frigate birds. Barbados is known as "the land of the flying fish"
                    and the fish is one of the national symbols of the country. The Exocet missile is named after them,
                    as variants are launched from underwater, and take a low trajectory, skimming the surface, before
                    striking their targets.</p>
                <h2 class="h2">Etymology</h2>
                <p>The term Exocoetidae is both the scientific name and the general name in Latin for a flying fish. The
                    suffix -idae, common for indicating a family, follows the root of the Latin word exocoetus, a
                    transliteration of the Ancient Greek name ἐξώκοιτος. This means literally 'sleeping outside', from
                    ἔξω, 'outside', and κοῖτος, 'bed', 'resting place', with the verb root κει-, 'to lie down' (not
                    'untruth'), so named as flying fish were believed to leave the water to sleep ashore, or due to
                    flying fish flying and thus stranding themselves in boats.</p>
