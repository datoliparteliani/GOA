                <h1 id="m">Lions</h1>
                <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a
                    muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip
                    of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent
                    mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult
                    males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on
                    medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions
                    scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do not
                    actively seek out and prey on humans. The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is
                    usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night
                    and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from
                    Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa
                    and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since
                    1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion
                    populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is
                    not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.
                    One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively
                    depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films. Lions have
                    been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for
                    exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions
                    of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and
                    medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range.</p>
                <h2 class="h2">Distribution and habitat</h2>
                <p>African lions live in scattered populations across sub-Saharan Africa. The lion prefers grassy plains
                    and savannahs, scrub bordering rivers, and open woodlands with bushes. It rarely enters closed
                    forests. On Mount Elgon, the lion has been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and
                    close to the snow line on Mount Kenya. Savannahs with an annual rainfall of 300 to 1,500 mm (12 to
                    59 in) make up the majority of lion habitat in Africa, estimated at 3,390,821 km2 (1,309,203 sq mi)
                    at most, but remnant populations are also present in tropical moist forests in West Africa and
                    montane forests in East Africa. The Asiatic lion now survives only in and around Gir National Park
                    in Gujarat, western India. Its habitat is a mixture of dry savannah forest and very dry, deciduous
                    scrub forest.</p>
