                <h1 style="color: red;" id="m">Christmas</h1>
                <p>Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus Christ, observed primarily on
                    December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. A
                    feast central to the liturgical year in Christianity, it follows the season of Advent (which begins
                    four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, and initiates the season of Christmastide, which
                    historically in the West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a
                    public holiday in many countries, is celebrated religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as
                    culturally by many non-Christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season surrounding it.
                    The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus,
                    says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary
                    arrived in the city, the inn had no room, and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child
                    was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then spread the word. There are
                    different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus's birth, and in the early fourth century, the
                    church fixed the date as December 25. It is exactly nine months after Annunciation on March 25, also
                    the date of the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar,
                    which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the
                    world. However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the
                    older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar. For
                    Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of
                    humanity rather than knowing Jesus's exact birth date is considered to be the primary purpose of
                    celebrating Christmas. The customs associated with Christmas in various countries have a mix of
                    pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular holiday traditions include gift
                    giving; completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath; Christmas music and caroling; watching
                    Christmas movies; viewing a Nativity play; an exchange of Christmas cards; attending church
                    services; a special meal; and displaying various Christmas decorations, including Christmas trees,
                    Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. Additionally, several
                    related and often interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas,
                    and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the Christmas season and have
                    their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas
                    festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key
                    sales period for retailers and businesses. Over the past few centuries, Christmas has had a steadily
                    growing economic effect in many regions of the world.</p>
                <h2 style="color: red;">Nativity</h2>
                <p>The gospels of Luke and Matthew describe Jesus as being born in Bethlehem to the Virgin Mary. In the
                    Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary travel from Nazareth to Bethlehem in order to be counted for a
                    census, and Jesus is born there and placed in a manger.[18] Angels proclaim him a savior for all
                    people, and three shepherds come to adore him. In the Gospel of Matthew, by contrast, three magi
                    follow a star to Bethlehem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the king of the Jews. King Herod orders the
                    massacre of all the boys less than two years old in Bethlehem, but the family flees to Egypt and
                    later returns to Nazareth.</p>
