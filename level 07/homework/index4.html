    <p>The Georgian tradition of hospitality is epitomized by the ceremonial feast of Supra. Supra is celebrated on birthdays, death days, weddings, anniversaries, national holidays, religious holidays, days of commemoration, in honor of a guest, and even ad hoc for no other reason than a fortuitous gathering of close friends. Either way, wine is consumed in ample quantities. At supra, wine shares equal importance with food. The dinner is comprised of a series of toasts offered by Tamada (“toast master”) to be embellished by the other guests. Topics include love, family, individual dedications, nationalist themes, life and death, and god. Blessings, jokes, anecdotes and humorous recollections are integral. Atourist invited to supra should expect multiple dedications which are usually translated by one of the younger attendants.</button>
