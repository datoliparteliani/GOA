                <h1>Frogs</h1>
                <p>A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless
                    amphibians
                    composing the order Anura[1] (coming from the Ancient Greek ἀνούρα, literally 'without tail'). The
                    oldest fossil "proto-frog" Triadobatrachus is known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar (250
                    million years ago), but molecular clock dating suggests their split from other amphibians may extend
                    further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the
                    tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical
                    rainforest. Frogs account for around 88% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five
                    most diverse vertebrate orders. Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction
                    between frogs and toads is informal, not from taxonomy or evolutionary history. An adult frog has a
                    stout body, protruding eyes, anteriorly-attached tongue, limbs folded
                    underneath, and no tail (the tail of tailed frogs is an extension of the male cloaca). Frogs have
                    glandular skin, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Their skin varies in colour from
                    well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black
                    to show toxicity and ward off predators. Adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land; some
                    species are adapted for living underground or in trees. Frogs typically lay their eggs in the water.
                    The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that
                    have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialised rasping mouth parts suitable for
                    herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose
                    into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally
                    have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few
                    feed on plant matter. Frog skin has a rich microbiome which is important to their health. Frogs are
                    extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source
                    for predators and part of the food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is
                    semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have
                    special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of vocalisations,
                    particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviors to
                    attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive. Frogs are valued as food by humans
                    and also have many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and
                    religion. They are also seen as environmental bellwethers, with declines in frog populations often
                    viewed as early warning signs of environmental damage. Frog populations have declined significantly
                    since the 1950s. More than one third of species are considered to be threatened with extinction and
                    over 120 are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among
                    frogs is on the rise and an emerging fungal disease, chytridiomycosis, has spread around the world.
                    Conservation biologists are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them.

                <h2>Etymology and taxonomy</h2>
                <p>The use of the common names frog and toad has no taxonomic justification. From a classification
                    perspective, all members of the order Anura are frogs, but only members of the family Bufonidae are
                    considered "true toads". The use of the term frog in common names usually refers to species that are
                    aquatic or semi-aquatic and have smooth, moist skins; the term toad generally refers to species that
                    are terrestrial with dry, warty skins.[2][3] There are numerous exceptions to this rule. The
                    European fire-bellied toad (Bombina bombina) has a slightly warty skin and prefers a watery
                    habitat[4] whereas the Panamanian golden frog (Atelopus zeteki) is in the toad family Bufonidae and
                    has a smooth skin The origin of the order name Anura—and its original spelling Anoures—is the
                    Ancient Greek alpha privative prefix ἀν- (an- from ἀ- before a vowel) 'without',[6] and οὐρά (ourá)
                    'animal tail'.[7] meaning "tailless". It refers to the tailless character of these
                    amphibians.[8][9][10] The origins of the word frog are uncertain and debated.[11] The word is first
                    attested in Old
                    English as frogga, but the usual Old English word for the frog was frosc (with variants such as frox
                    and forsc), and it is agreed that the word frog is somehow related to this. Old English frosc
                    remained in dialectal use in English as frosh and frosk into the nineteenth century,[12] and is
                    paralleled widely in other Germanic languages, with examples in the modern languages including
                    German Frosch, Norwegian frosk, Icelandic froskur, and Dutch (kik)vors.[11] These words allow
                    reconstruction of a Common Germanic ancestor *froskaz.[13] The third edition of the Oxford English
                    Dictionary finds that the etymology of *froskaz is uncertain, but agrees with arguments that it
                    could plausibly derive from a Proto-Indo-European base along the lines of *preu, meaning 'jump'.[11]
                    How Old English frosc gave rise to frogga is, however, uncertain, as the development does not
                    involve a regular sound-change. Instead, it seems that there was a trend in Old English to coin
                    nicknames for animals ending in -g, with examples—themselves all of uncertain etymology—including
                    dog, hog, pig, stag, and (ear)wig. Frog appears to have been adapted from frosc as part of this
                    trend.[11] Meanwhile, the word toad, first attested as Old English tādige, is unique to English and
                    is likewise
                    of uncertain etymology.[14] It is the basis for the word tadpole, first attested as Middle English
                    taddepol, apparently meaning 'toad-head'.</p>
