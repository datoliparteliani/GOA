                <h1>Belgian cuisine</h1>
                <p>Belgian cuisine is widely varied among regions, while also reflecting the cuisines of neighbouring
                    France, Germany and the Netherlands. It is characterised by the combination of French cuisine with
                    the more hearty Flemish fare. Outside the country, Belgium is best known for its chocolate, waffles,
                    fries and beer. Though Belgium has many distinctive national dishes, many internationally popular
                    foods like
                    hamburgers and spaghetti bolognese are also popular in Belgium, and most of what Belgians eat is
                    also eaten in neighbouring countries. "Belgian cuisine" therefore usually refers to dishes of
                    Belgian origin, or those considered typically Belgian. Belgian cuisine traditionally prizes regional
                    and seasonal ingredients. Ingredients typical in
                    Belgian dishes include potatoes, leeks, grey shrimp, white asparagus, Belgian endive, horse meat and
                    local beer, in addition to common European staples including meat, cheese and butter. Belgians
                    typically eat four meals a day, with a light breakfast, medium lunch, a snack, and a large dinner.
                    Belgium has a plethora of local dishes and products. Examples include waterzooi from Ghent, couque
                    biscuit from the town of Dinant, and tarte au riz from Verviers. While their local origins are
                    acknowledged, most such dishes are enjoyed throughout Belgium.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Little is known about early Belgian cuisine. It can only be assumed that it was similar to that of
                    other early European tribes. The ancient Belgians probably kept animals like sheep and cattle, grew
                    root vegetables, hunted for animals such as the wild boar, fished, and foraged for berries and
                    herbs. Beer was brewed as well, although not with hops (a later discovery). The transition from
                    appropriation to agriculture is thought to have occurred around 2000 BC, with
                    migrants travelling across the continent along the Danube and Rhine rivers. Small, cultivated plots
                    of land grew primitive varieties of wheat (e.g. emmer and einkorn), barley, and legumes (e.g.
                    lentils and peas). Goats were bred for dairy products, sheep provided wool, and pigs provided meat.
                    Wealthier families regularly ate meat, while the poor subsisted primarily on legumes, milk, and
                    cereals in the form of porridge or bread. The Celtic tribes of the Belgae, who settled in Belgium
                    around 300 BC, brought with them not only
                    the wheeled plough and three-field crop rotation, but also enriched the diet with poultry (e.g.
                    chicken and geese), mead and hops beer. Salt-cured beef was exported from the British Isles to the
                    continent. In 54 BC, the region of northern Gaul was conquered by Caesar's troops and passed into
                    Roman possession for four centuries. The Roman Empire had an extensive road network, which played a
                    significant role in the economic development of the empire, and in particular, individual cities.
                    Active trade led to the spread of products from other regions of the empire to the territory of
                    Gallia Belgica (e.g. olive oil and wine from the Mediterranean). To meet the growing needs of the
                    Roman army, increasing quantities of food were required. Thus,
                    around the year 100 AD, tracts of forest in Belgica were cleared to plant crops. Wheat, barley and
                    spelt were grown on fertile soils, while legumes and rye were grown on less fertile soils. New
                    varieties of vegetables and herbs were presumably introduced to the region (e.g. cabbage and other
                    brassicas, carrots, onions, beets, dill, coriander, and thyme), as well as many fruits (e.g. apples,
                    pears, grapes, plums, and peaches), but they only became widespread in the 2nd century AD.[3]
                    Livestock numbers also increased. Some regions of Belgica specialised in the production of salted
                    ham and pork, and were known to be a large supplier of those products for many cities across the
                    empire. Archaeological excavations near the town of Tienen have given insight into the cuisine of
                    Belgica in
                    the 1st and 2nd centuries AD: cereals (e.g. wheat, spelt, and barley), legumes (e.g. lentils, peas,
                    and beans), fruits (e.g. plums, cherries, pears, and grapes), nuts (e.g. walnuts and hazelnuts), in
                    addition to olive oil, porridge, bread, salt, and fennel. For most of the population, the main
                    dish was puls: cereals mixed with water or milk, heated and with a little olive oil added, then
                    served with lentils or beans. Another important product was bread, to which honey or legumes were
                    sometimes added when baking. Meat was rarely eaten (either fried or in vegetable soups), except
                    freshwater fish (e.g. eel, pike, and trout). Water was the main beverage, in addition to milk, beer,
                    and wine diluted with water and flavoured with spices. Rich people could afford to eat meat and wine
                    more often. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the ruined and decayed territories of former
                    Belgica were settled by Franks and Germanic peoples. They combined crop cultivation and livestock
                    farming with hunting and gathering, but abandoned some of the food traditions of Belgica, such as
                    fish sauce. They also favoured butter over olive oil and ale over wine. At the end of the 5th
                    century, Clovis I united the former possessions of Gaul and founded the
                    Frankish Kingdom. During his reign, the Franks were baptised, and from then on the church began to
                    play an increasing role in the development of the kingdom, including greatly influencing the
                    culinary traditions of Belgium. Presumably, the history of Belgian brewing began with breweries at
                    monasteries, and the monks also produced cheese. In addition, the Catholic Church prescribed fasting
                    on certain days, of which there were at least 195 per year. This led to a reduction of meat
                    products in the diet in the 10th–11th centuries, while bread, fish and eggs became more popular.
                    Over time, the County of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant became some of the most economically
                    developed regions of Europe. Instead of a three-field system, the Flemish people began to fertilise
                    the land, which allowed them to harvest twice a year and raise more livestock. The Flemish and
                    Brabant cities of Bruges, Antwerp, and Ghent became the largest trading cities in Europe, where the
                    richest people settled and where goods were brought from all over the world, including spices from
                    India and exotic fruits from warm countries. In the 13th to 15th centuries, great importance was
                    attached to table setting and serving dishes.[7] From then on, dishes had to be not only filling,
                    but also pleasing to the eye. To achieve this, before serving, dishes were decorated with greens,
                    crumbled eggs, seasoned with spices that gave colour (e.g. saffron), and poured with sauces. The
                    food of common people consisted mainly of bread (due to low prices, bread was eaten in large
                    quantities[8]), beer, vegetable soups, meat, as well as fruit pies, pancakes, and waffles. Most
                    often they ate beef and lamb; only wealthy families could afford pork, poultry and game. In the 15th
                    century, the port city of Antwerp became one of the most important economic centres in
                    Europe. With the discovery of America, products such as potatoes, tomatoes, turkey, and cocoa became
                    available. Brewing also developed intensively in Antwerp.[9] In the 15th and 16th centuries, the
                    first cookbooks appeared in Belgium. While the menu of wealthy Belgians consisted of a variety of
                    dishes and elaborate desserts, the poor still subsisted on bread, beer and vegetable soups. Potatoes
                    were initially perceived as pig feed, but by 1830 they had become the staple dish of the poor. In
                    the 18th and 19th centuries, the Flemish cities lost their former importance, and the
                    French-speaking territories of Belgium, especially Liège and Mons, took the lead. Many culinary
                    traditions came to Wallonia from neighbouring France. First of all, various meat and fish dishes,
                    expensive seafood (e.g. lobsters and oysters), as well as exotic fruits (e.g. pineapple and melon),
                    became popular dishes at that time; seasonal vegetables went out of fashion. Sauces, potatoes, and
                    offal were widely used. In the 19th century, restaurants began to appear; cookbooks were now
                    published for the middle class as well. As a result of the Belgian Revolution of 1830, Belgium
                    gained its independence. Brussels was chosen
                    as the capital of the new kingdom, where young dynamic businessmen, diplomats, and politicians
                    settled. An increasing number of restaurants, cafés, and bars appeared in the capital, some of which
                    were recognised as the best in Europe. Brussels chefs successfully combined French cuisine with
                    elements of Flemish and Walloon dishes.[11] The city is also known as the birthplace of the Belgian
                    endive. The technique for growing blanched endives was accidentally discovered in the 1850s at the
                    Botanical Garden of Brussels in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode. In the 20th century, more exotic fruits and
                    vegetables were introduced (e.g. bananas, kiwis,
                    avocados, sweet peppers and aubergines), which gradually entered the everyday life of Belgians only
                    with the spread of supermarkets. Many products became available to the working class. Some culinary
                    traditions were lost because working class women, in order to save time, began to cook only the
                    simplest and most nourishing dishes.[7] At the same time, convenience foods and fast food became
                    increasingly popular (e.g. spaghetti bolognese, pizza, and hamburgers), which negatively affected
                    the nation's health. Recently, Belgians have become more health-conscious, so many families favour
                    light, healthy meals with lots of vegetables,[13] as well as fresh, natural products without
                    chemical additives.</p>
