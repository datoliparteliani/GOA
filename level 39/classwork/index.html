                    <h1>Guinea pig</h1>
                    <p>The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as the cavy or domestic cavy
                        (/ˈkeɪvi/
                        KAY-vee), is a species of rodent belonging to the genus Cavia, family Caviidae. Breeders tend to
                        use
                        the
                        name "cavy" for the animal, but "guinea pig" is more commonly used in scientific and laboratory
                        contexts.
                        Despite their name, guinea pigs are not native to Guinea, nor are they closely related to pigs.
                        Instead,
                        they originated in the Andes region of South America, where wild guinea pigs can still be found
                        today.
                        Studies based on biochemistry and DNA hybridization suggest they are domesticated animals that
                        do
                        not exist
                        naturally in the wild, but are descendants of a closely related cavy species such as C.
                        tschudii.
                        Originally, they were domesticated as livestock (source of meat) in the Andean region and are
                        still
                        consumed
                        in some parts of the world. In Western society, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity
                        as
                        a pet
                        since its introduction to
                        Europe and North America by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, friendly
                        responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them have continued
                        to
                        make
                        guinea pigs a popular choice of household pets. Consequently, organizations devoted to the
                        competitive
                        breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide. Through artificial selection, many
                        specialized
                        breeds
                        with varying coat colors and textures have been selected by breeders. Livestock breeds of guinea
                        pig
                        play an
                        important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean peoples,
                        especially as a food source. They are not only used in folk medicine and in community religious
                        ceremonies but also raised for their meat. Guinea pigs are an important culinary staple in the
                        Andes
                        Mountains, where it is known as cuy. Lately, marketers tried to increase their consumption
                        outside
                        South
                        America. Biological experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th
                        century. The
                        animals
                        were used so frequently as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries that the epithet
                        guinea
                        pig came
                        into use to describe a human test subject. Since that time, they have mainly been replaced by
                        other
                        rodents,
                        such as mice and rats. However, they are still used in research, primarily as models to study
                        such
                        human
                        medical conditions as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy (like humans, they require dietary
                        intake of
                        vitamin C), and pregnancy complications.</p>

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Cavia porcellus is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descended from closely related
                        species of cavies, such as C. aperea, C. fulgida, and C. tschudii. These closely related species
                        are
                        still commonly found in various regions of South America. Studies from 2007 to 2010 applying
                        molecular markers, and morphometric studies on the skull and skeletal morphology of current
                        and mummified animals revealed the ancestor to be most likely C. tschudii. Some species of cavy,
                        identified in the 20th century as C. anolaimae and C. guianae, may be domestic guinea pigs that
                        have
                        become feral by reintroduction into the wild. Regionally known as cuy (Spanish word derived from
                        quechua quwi), the guinea pig was first
                        domesticated as early as 5000 BC for food by tribes in the Andean region of South America (the
                        present-day southern part of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia), some thousands years after
                        the domestication of the South American camelids. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped
                        animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art. Early accounts from Spanish settlers
                        state
                        that guinea pigs were the preferred sacrificial animal of
                        the Inca people native to Peru. These claims are supported by archaeological digs and
                        transcribed Quechua mythology, providing evidence that sacrificial rituals involving guinea pigs
                        served many purposes in society such as appeasing the gods, accompanying the dead, or reading
                        the
                        future. From about 1200 to the Spanish conquest in 1532, the indigenous people used selective
                        breeding to
                        develop many varieties of domestic guinea pigs, forming the basis for some modern domestic
                        breeds. They continue to be a food source in the region; many households in the Andean highlands
                        raise the animal.</p>
