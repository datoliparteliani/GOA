                    <h1>Plants</h1>
                    <p>Plants are the eukaryotes that form the kingdom Plantae; they are predominantly photosynthetic.
                        This means that they obtain their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from
                        endosymbiosis with cyanobacteria to produce sugars from carbon dioxide and water, using the
                        green pigment chlorophyll. Exceptions are parasitic plants that have lost the genes for
                        chlorophyll and photosynthesis, and obtain their energy from other plants or fungi. Most plants
                        are multicellular, except for some green algae. Historically, as in Aristotle's biology, the
                        plant kingdom encompassed all living things that
                        were not animals, and included algae and fungi. Definitions have narrowed since then; current
                        definitions exclude the fungi and some of the algae. By the definition used in this article,
                        plants form the clade Viridiplantae (green plants), which consists of the green algae and the
                        embryophytes or land plants (hornworts, liverworts, mosses, lycophytes, ferns, conifers and
                        other gymnosperms, and flowering plants). A definition based on genomes includes the
                        Viridiplantae, along with the red algae and the glaucophytes, in the clade Archaeplastida. There
                        are about 380,000 known species of plants, of which the majority, some 260,000, produce
                        seeds. They range in size from single cells to the tallest trees. Green plants provide a
                        substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen; the sugars they create supply the energy
                        for most of Earth's ecosystems, and other organisms, including animals, either eat plants
                        directly or rely on organisms which do so. Grain, fruit, and vegetables are basic human foods
                        and have been domesticated for millennia.
                        People use plants for many purposes, such as building materials, ornaments, writing materials,
                        and, in great variety, for medicines. The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a
                        branch of biology. All living things were traditionally placed into one of two groups, plants
                        and animals. This classification dates from Aristotle (384–322 BC), who distinguished different
                        levels of beings in his biology,[5] based on whether living things had a "sensitive soul" or
                        like plants only a "vegetative soul".[6] Theophrastus, Aristotle's student, continued his work
                        in plant taxonomy and classification.[7] Much later, Linnaeus (1707–1778) created the basis of
                        the modern system of scientific classification, but retained the animal and plant kingdoms,
                        naming the plant kingdom the Vegetabilia.</p>

                    <h2>Evolution</h2>
                    <p>There are about 382,000 accepted species of plants,[15] of which the great majority, some
                        283,000, produce seeds.[16] The table below shows some species count estimates of different
                        green plant (Viridiplantae) divisions. About 85–90% of all plants are flowering plants. Several
                        projects are currently attempting to collect records on all plant species in online databases,
                        e.g. the World Flora Online. Plants range in scale from single-celled organisms such as desmids
                        (from 10 micrometres (μm)
                        across) and picozoa (less than 3 μm across),[18][19] to the largest trees (megaflora) such as
                        the conifer Sequoia sempervirens (up to 120 metres (380 ft) tall) and the angiosperm Eucalyptus
                        regnans (up to 100 m (325 ft) tall). The ancestors of land plants evolved in water. An algal
                        scum formed on the land 1,200 million years ago, but it was not until the Ordovician, around 450
                        million years ago, that the first land plants appeared, with a level of organisation like that
                        of bryophytes.[34][35] However, fossils of organisms with a flattened thallus in Precambrian
                        rocks suggest that multicellular freshwater eukaryotes existed over 1000 mya. Primitive land
                        plants began to diversify in the late Silurian, around 420 million years ago.
                        Bryophytes, club mosses, and ferns then appear in the fossil record.[37] Early plant anatomy is
                        preserved in cellular detail in an early Devonian fossil assemblage from the Rhynie chert. These
                        early plants were preserved by being petrified in chert formed in silica-rich volcanic hot
                        springs. By the end of the Devonian, most of the basic features of plants today were present,
                        including
                        roots, leaves and secondary wood in trees such as Archaeopteris.[39][40] The Carboniferous
                        period saw the development of forests in swampy environments dominated by clubmosses and
                        horsetails, including some as large as trees, and the appearance of early gymnosperms, the first
                        seed plants.[41] The Permo-Triassic extinction event radically changed the structures of
                        communities.[42] This may have set the scene for the evolution of flowering plants in the
                        Triassic (~200 million years ago), with an adaptive radiation in the Cretaceous so rapid that
                        Darwin called it an "abominable mystery".[43][44][45] Conifers diversified from the Late
                        Triassic onwards, and became a dominant part of floras in the Jurassic. In 2019, a phylogeny
                        based on genomes and transcriptomes from 1,153 plant species was proposed.[48] The placing of
                        algal groups is supported by phylogenies based on genomes from the Mesostigmatophyceae and
                        Chlorokybophyceae that have since been sequenced. Both the "chlorophyte algae" and the
                        "streptophyte algae" are treated as paraphyletic (vertical bars beside phylogenetic tree
                        diagram) in this analysis, as the land plants arose from within those groups.[49][50] The
                        classification of Bryophyta is supported both by Puttick et al. 2018,[51] and by phylogenies
                        involving the hornwort genomes that have also since been sequenced.</p>
