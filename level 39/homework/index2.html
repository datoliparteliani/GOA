                    <h1>Birds</h1>
                    <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves (Latin: [ˈaveːs]),
                        characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high
                        metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live
                        worldwide and range in size from the 5.5 cm (2.2 in) bee hummingbird to the 2.8 m (9 ft 2 in)
                        common ostrich. There are over 11,000 living species and they are split into 44 orders. More
                        than half are passerine or "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according
                        to species; the only known groups without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings,
                        which are modified forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led
                        to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island
                        species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted for flight.
                        Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have
                        further evolved for swimming. The study of birds is called ornithology. Birds are feathered
                        theropod dinosaurs and constitute the only known living dinosaurs. Likewise,
                        birds are considered reptiles in the modern cladistic sense of the term, and their closest
                        living relatives are the crocodilians. Birds are descendants of the primitive avialans (whose
                        members include Archaeopteryx) which first appeared during the Late Jurassic. According to some
                        estimates, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Late Cretaceous or between the Early and
                        Late Cretaceous (100 Ma) and diversified dramatically around the time of the
                        Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago, which killed off the pterosaurs and
                        all non-ornithuran dinosaurs. Many social species preserve knowledge across generations
                        (culture). Birds are social,
                        communicating with visual signals, calls, and songs, and participating in such behaviour as
                        cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird
                        species are socially (but not necessarily sexually) monogamous, usually for one breeding season
                        at a time, sometimes for years, and rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that
                        are polygynous (one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (one female with many
                        males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction.
                        They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period
                        of parental care after hatching. Many species of birds are economically important as food for
                        human consumption and raw material
                        in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds being important sources of eggs,
                        meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird
                        excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds figure throughout human culture. About
                        120 to 130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and
                        hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction,
                        though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of
                        the ecotourism industry.</p>

                    <h2>Evolution and classification</h2>
                    <p>The first classification of birds was developed by Francis Willughby and John Ray in their 1676
                        volume Ornithologiae.[9] Carl Linnaeus modified that work in 1758 to devise the taxonomic
                        classification system currently in use.[10] Birds are categorised as the biological class Aves
                        in Linnaean taxonomy. Phylogenetic taxonomy places Aves in the clade Theropoda as an
                        infraclass[11] or more recently a subclass. Aves and a sister group, the order Crocodilia,
                        contain the only living representatives of the reptile clade Archosauria. During the late 1990s,
                        Aves was most commonly defined phylogenetically as all descendants of the most recent common
                        ancestor of modern birds and Archaeopteryx lithographica.[13] However, an earlier definition
                        proposed by Jacques Gauthier gained wide currency in the 21st century, and is used by many
                        scientists including adherents to the PhyloCode. Gauthier defined Aves to include only the crown
                        group of the set of modern birds. This was done by excluding most groups known only from
                        fossils, and assigning them, instead, to the broader group Avialae,[14] on the principle that a
                        clade based on extant species should be limited to those extant species and their closest
                        extinct relatives. Gauthier and de Queiroz identified four different definitions for the same
                        biological name
                        "Aves", which is a problem.[15] The authors proposed to reserve the term Aves only for the crown
                        group consisting of the last common ancestor of all living birds and all of its descendants,[15]
                        which corresponds to meaning number 4 below. They assigned other names to the other groups.</p>
