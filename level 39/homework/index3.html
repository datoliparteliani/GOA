                    <h1>Reptiles</h1>
                    <p>Reptiles, as commonly defined, are a group of tetrapods with an ectothermic ('cold-blooded')
                        metabolism and amniotic development. Living reptiles comprise four orders: Testudines (turtles),
                        Crocodilia (crocodilians), Squamata (lizards and snakes), and Rhynchocephalia (the tuatara). As
                        of May 2023, about 12,000 living species of reptiles are listed in the Reptile Database.[2] The
                        study of the traditional reptile orders, customarily in combination with the study of modern
                        amphibians, is called herpetology. Reptiles have been subject to several conflicting taxonomic
                        definitions.[3] In Linnaean
                        taxonomy, reptiles are gathered together under the class Reptilia (/rɛpˈtɪliə/ rep-TIL-ee-ə),
                        which corresponds to common usage. Modern cladistic taxonomy regards that group as paraphyletic,
                        since genetic and paleontological evidence has determined that birds (class Aves), as members of
                        Dinosauria, are more closely related to living crocodilians than to other reptiles, and are thus
                        nested among reptiles from an evolutionary perspective. Many cladistic systems therefore
                        redefine Reptilia as a clade (monophyletic group) including birds, though the precise definition
                        of this clade varies between authors.[4][3] Others prioritize the clade Sauropsida, which
                        typically refers to all amniotes more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals. The
                        earliest known proto-reptiles originated from the Carboniferous period, having evolved from
                        advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods which became increasingly adapted to life on dry land. The
                        earliest known eureptile ("true reptile") was Hylonomus, a small and superficially lizard-like
                        animal which lived in Nova Scotia during the Bashkirian age of the Late Carboniferous, around
                        318 million years ago.[1] Genetic and fossil data argues that the two largest lineages of
                        reptiles, Archosauromorpha (crocodilians, birds, and kin) and Lepidosauromorpha (lizards, and
                        kin), diverged during the Permian period.[5] In addition to the living reptiles, there are many
                        diverse groups that are now extinct, in some cases due to mass extinction events. In particular,
                        the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event wiped out the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, and all
                        non-avian dinosaurs alongside many species of crocodyliforms and squamates (e.g., mosasaurs).
                        Modern non-bird reptiles inhabit all the continents except Antarctica. Reptiles are tetrapod
                        vertebrates, creatures that either have four limbs or, like snakes, are
                        descended from four-limbed ancestors. Unlike amphibians, reptiles do not have an aquatic larval
                        stage. Most reptiles are oviparous, although several species of squamates are viviparous, as
                        were some extinct aquatic clades[6]  – the fetus develops within the mother, using a
                        (non-mammalian) placenta rather than contained in an eggshell. As amniotes, reptile eggs are
                        surrounded by membranes for protection and transport, which adapt them to reproduction on dry
                        land. Many of the viviparous species feed their fetuses through various forms of placenta
                        analogous to those of mammals, with some providing initial care for their hatchlings. Extant
                        reptiles range in size from a tiny gecko, Sphaerodactylus ariasae, which can grow up to 17 mm
                        (0.7 in) to the saltwater crocodile, Crocodylus porosus, which can reach over 6 m (19.7 ft) in
                        length and weigh over 1,000 kg (2,200 lb).</p>

                    <h2>Classification</h2>
                    <p>In the 13th century, the category of reptile was recognized in Europe as consisting of a
                        miscellany of egg-laying creatures, including "snakes, various fantastic monsters, lizards,
                        assorted amphibians, and worms", as recorded by Beauvais in his Mirror of Nature.[7] In the 18th
                        century, the reptiles were, from the outset of classification, grouped with the amphibians.
                        Linnaeus, working from species-poor Sweden, where the common adder and grass snake are often
                        found hunting in water, included all reptiles and amphibians in class "III – Amphibia" in his
                        Systema Naturæ.[8] The terms reptile and amphibian were largely interchangeable, reptile (from
                        Latin repere, 'to creep') being preferred by the French.[9] J.N. Laurenti was the first to
                        formally use the term Reptilia for an expanded selection of reptiles and amphibians basically
                        similar to that of Linnaeus.[10] Today, the two groups are still commonly treated under the
                        single heading herpetology. It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that it became
                        clear that reptiles and amphibians are, in fact, quite different animals, and P.A. Latreille
                        erected the class Batracia (1825) for the latter, dividing the tetrapods into the four familiar
                        classes of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals.[11] The British anatomist T.H. Huxley made
                        Latreille's definition popular and, together with Richard Owen, expanded Reptilia to include the
                        various fossil "antediluvian monsters", including dinosaurs and the mammal-like (synapsid)
                        Dicynodon he helped describe. This was not the only possible classification scheme: In the
                        Hunterian lectures delivered at the Royal College of Surgeons in 1863, Huxley grouped the
                        vertebrates into mammals, sauroids, and ichthyoids (the latter containing the fishes and
                        amphibians). He subsequently proposed the names of Sauropsida and Ichthyopsida for the latter
                        two groups.[12] In 1866, Haeckel demonstrated that vertebrates could be divided based on their
                        reproductive strategies, and that reptiles, birds, and mammals were united by the amniotic egg.
                        The terms Sauropsida ("lizard faces") and Theropsida ("beast faces") were used again in 1916 by
                        E.S. Goodrich to distinguish between lizards, birds, and their relatives on the one hand
                        (Sauropsida) and mammals and their extinct relatives (Theropsida) on the other. Goodrich
                        supported this division by the nature of the hearts and blood vessels in each group, and other
                        features, such as the structure of the forebrain. According to Goodrich, both lineages evolved
                        from an earlier stem group, Protosauria ("first lizards") in which he included some animals
                        today considered reptile-like amphibians, as well as early reptiles. In 1956, D.M.S. Watson
                        observed that the first two groups diverged very early in reptilian
                        history, so he divided Goodrich's Protosauria between them. He also reinterpreted Sauropsida and
                        Theropsida to exclude birds and mammals, respectively. Thus his Sauropsida included
                        Procolophonia, Eosuchia, Millerosauria, Chelonia (turtles), Squamata (lizards and snakes),
                        Rhynchocephalia, Crocodilia, "thecodonts" (paraphyletic basal Archosauria), non-avian dinosaurs,
                        pterosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and sauropterygians. in the late 19th century, a number of definitions
                        of Reptilia were offered. The biological
                        traits listed by Lydekker in 1896, for example, include a single occipital condyle, a jaw joint
                        formed by the quadrate and articular bones, and certain characteristics of the vertebrae.[15]
                        The animals singled out by these formulations, the amniotes other than the mammals and the
                        birds, are still those considered reptiles today.</p>
