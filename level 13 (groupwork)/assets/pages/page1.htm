        <p>The series adapts Kubo's manga with the main story arcs and introduces anime exclusive ones. In Karakura Town,
        high school student Ichigo Kurosaki becomes a substitute Soul Reaper (死神, Shinigami, literally, "Death God"),
        when Rukia Kuchiki risks her life to protect him from a Hollow. Although initially reluctant to accept his
        responsibility, he takes her place, and during this time they discover that a few classmates are spiritually
        aware and have their own powers: Quincy survivor Uryū Ishida uses spiritual particles, Orihime Inoue has a group
        of protective spirits called Shun Shun Rikka and Yasutora Sado ("Chad") has strength equal to the Hollows
        encased in his arm.
        When Rukia is sentenced to death for transgressions in the human world and sent to the Soul Society, Ichigo
        meets Kisuke Urahara and Yoruichi Shihōin, the duo of exiled Soul Reapers. They allow him and his friends to
        save Rukia. After this, it is revealed that ex-squad captain Sōsuke Aizen framed Rukia for the crime and has
        been illegally experimenting on Soul Reapers and Hollows. Aizen plans to conquer the Soul Society by using the
        Hōgyoku, a legendary powerful substance turning Hollows into half Soul Reapers. After faking his death and his
        reappearance caused a fight with some people, Aizen escapes into Hueco Mundo, the realm of Hollows, and later
        kidnaps Orihime as she is instrumental in creating the Oken, a power that will allow him to kill the Soul King,
        the ruler of the Soul Society.
        <br><br>
        After being trained by the Vizards, other exiled Soul Reapers and the victims of Aizen's experiment, Ichigo and
        his friends travel into Hueco Mundo. Facing a group of Arrancars, who are Hollows given Soul Reaper abilities,
        led by an elite group known as the Espadas, which are composed of ten Arrancars with exemplary strength. Espadas
        serve as commanders in Aizen's army and each has the factions of weaker Arrancars. Along with Aizen, Gin
        Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen, the Espada as a group possess comparable strength to Soul Reaper captains. After
        rescuing Orihime, Aizen reveals her kidnapping was a distraction to allow him to take Karakura Town, as its
        spiritual energy is what is needed for the Oken. After being trained by his father Isshin, another exiled Soul
        Reaper, Ichigo sacrifices his power to seal Aizen away when the Hōgyoku rejects its master, and the Soul Reapers
        defeat the Espadas.

        Months later, Chad and the members reveal themselves as Fullbringers in a group called Xcution. They can give up
        their powers to restore other ones and they plan on doing so for Ichigo, who uses the power of Fullbringer.
        However, it is all a ruse by their leader Kugo Ginjo, a Fullbringer and former Substitute Soul Reaper, to
        extract his powers and empower all of them. Ichigo has his Soul Reaper powers restored, when he gains his trust
        from the Soul Society. After helping other Soul Reapers defeat Ginjo's team, Ichigo resumes his duty as a
        Substitute Soul Reaper.

        of spiritual humans who are immortal longer by stealing souls. Their leader, Jin Kariya, seeks to destroy the
        Soul Society in revenge. However, Ichigo and his allies defeat them. The second arc focuses on Shūsuke Amagai, a
        Soul Reaper captain replacing Ichimaru. Amagai seeks revenge against Captain Yamamoto for the death of his

        third arc features the evil Zanpakutō spirit Muramasa, who turns itself and other ones into spiritual beings to

        and transforms into a monstrous creature that Ichigo defeats, but after Muramasa reveals the intention was to
        have Soul Reapers and Zanpakutō communicate on equal terms. The fourth and final arc features an event in which
