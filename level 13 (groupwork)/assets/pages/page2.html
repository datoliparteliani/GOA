        <p>Noriyuki Abe was chosen as director of the series while Masashi Sogo [ja] acted as head writer for episodes
            1–212. Tsuyoshi Kida was the head writer for episodes 230–265. Kento Shimoyama held the title of head writer

            The music of Bleach was composed by Shirō Sagisu. Sagisu's musical score for the television series was
            released in four-CD sets. Four additional CDs were released for the music composed for the four Bleach
            animated films.

            During the production and broadcast of the first 167 episodes, the screen size was in 4:3; episodes 168

            In a 2009 interview, Kubo and Kudō discussed the original story for the anime adaptation, Zanpakutō: The
            Alternate Tale, with Kubo expressing that he desired to borrow events and concepts within it for the manga.
            Kubo also revealed that his art style varied in the production of the work and only became cemented after
            the airing of the anime. He acknowledged that his art style has changed as a result of his work and gave an
            example that he no longer draws hair growing from behind the ears of characters.

            On October 5, 2024, Aniplex released an animated video to celebrate the anime series' 20th anniversary. The
            video features climactic scenes from the series, animated in the new Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War anime
            style.
