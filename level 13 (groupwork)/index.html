        <p id="bleach1"><strong>Bleach</strong> (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese anime television series based on
            <mark>Tite
                Kubo's</mark> original manga series of the same name. It was produced by <mark>Pierrot</mark> and
            directed by <mark>Noriyuki
                Abe</mark>. The series aired on TV Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. The
            story follows
            the adventures of <mark>Ichigo Kurosaki</mark> after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death
            personification
            similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, <mark>Rukia Kuchiki</mark>. His newfound powers force
            him to take on
            the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. In addition to
            adapting the manga series it is based on, the anime periodically includes original self-contained storylines
            and characters not found in the source material. Viz Media obtained foreign television and home video
            distribution rights to the Bleach anime in March 2006. Bleach was broadcast in the United States on Adult
            Swim from September 2006 to November 2014.
