        <h1 class="h1-1">Bruce Lee</h1>
        <p class="p1">Bruce Lee[b] (born Lee Jun-fan;[c] November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong-American
            martial artist, actor, filmmaker, and philosopher. He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts
            philosophy which was formed from Lee's experiences in unarmed fighting and self-defense—as well as eclectic,
            Zen Buddhist and Taoist philosophies—as a new school of martial arts thought.[3][4] With a film career
            spanning Hong Kong and the United States,[5][6][7] Li is regarded as the first global Chinese film star and
            one of the most influential martial artists in the history of cinema.[8] Known for his roles in five
            feature-length martial arts films, Lee is credited with helping popularize martial arts films in the 1970s
            and promoting Hong Kong action cinema.[9][10] Born in San Francisco and raised in British Hong Kong, Lee was
            introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as
            a child actor by his father.[11] His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun (trained under Ip
            Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and frequent street fighting (neighborhood
            and rooftop fights). In 1959, Lee moved to Seattle, where he enrolled at the University of Washington in
            1961.[12] It was during this time in the United States that he began considering making money by teaching
            martial arts, even though he aspired to have a career in acting. He opened his first martial arts school,
            operated out of his home in Seattle. After later adding a second school in Oakland, California, he once drew
            significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of California by making
            demonstrations and speaking. He subsequently moved to Los Angeles to teach, where his students included
            Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His roles in America, including playing Kato in The
            Green Hornet introduced him to American audiences, but
            the cultural frictions that existed did not allow Lee to fully express himself. After returning to Hong Kong
            in 1971, Lee landed his first leading role in The Big Boss, directed by Lo Wei. A year later he starred in
            Fist of Fury, in which he portrayed Chen Zhen, and The Way of the Dragon, directed and written by Lee. He
            went on to star in the US-Hong Kong co-production Enter the Dragon (1973) and The Game of Death (1978).[13]
            His Hong Kong and Hollywood-produced films, all of which were commercially successful, elevated Hong Kong
            martial arts films to a new level of popularity and acclaim, sparking a surge of Western interest in Chinese
            martial arts. The direction and tone of his films, including their fight choreography and
            diversification,[14] dramatically influenced and changed martial arts and martial arts films worldwide.[15]
            With his influence, kung fu films began to displace the wuxia film genre—fights were choreographed more
            realistically, fantasy elements were discarded for real-world conflicts, and the characterisation of the
            male lead went from simply being a chivalrous hero to one that embodied the notion of masculinity.[16] Lee's
            career was cut short by his sudden death at age 33 from a brain edema.[17] Nevertheless, his films
            remained popular, gained a large cult following,[9] and became widely imitated and exploited. He became an
            iconic figure known throughout the world, particularly among the Chinese, based upon his portrayal of
            Cantonese culture in his films,[18] and among Asian Americans for defying Asian stereotypes in the United
            States.[19] Since his death, Lee has continued to be a prominent influence on modern combat sports,
            including judo, karate, mixed martial arts, and boxing, as well as modern popular culture, including film,
            television, comics, animation, and video games. Time named Lee one of the 100 most important people of the
            20th century.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-1">Career</h2>
        <p class="p2">Lee's father Lee Hoi-chuen was a Cantonese opera star. As a result, Junior Lee was introduced to
            the world of cinema at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child. Lee had his first role as
            a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film Golden Gate Girl.[25] He took his Chinese stage name as
            李小龍, lit. "Lee the Little Dragon", for the fact that he was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon
            by the Chinese zodiac. As a nine-year-old, he co-starred with his father in The Kid in 1950, which was based
            on a comic book
            character, "Kid Cheung", and was his first leading role.[27] By the time he was 18, he had appeared in 20
            films.[26] After attending Tak Sun School (德信學校; several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road, Kowloon),
            Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at age 12. n 1956, due to poor
            academic performance (and possibly poor conduct), he was transferred to St. Francis Xavier's College, where
            he was mentored by Brother Edward Muss, F.M.S., a Bavarian-born teacher and coach of the school boxing
            team.[24][29][30] After Lee was involved in several street fights, his parents decided that he needed to be
            trained in martial arts.[citation needed] In 1953, Lee's friend William Cheung introduced him to Ip
            Man,[31][32] but his European background on his
            mother's side meant he was initially rejected from learning Wing Chun kung fu under him because of the
            long-standing rule in the Chinese martial arts world not to teach foreigners.[33][34][additional citation(s)
            needed] Cheung spoke on his behalf and Lee was accepted into the school and began training in Wing Chun with
            Ip Man.[35][36] Ip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging
            them to fight in organized competitions.[37] After a year of his training with Ip Man, most of the other
            students refused to train with Lee. They had
            learned of his mixed ancestry, and the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques
            to non-Asians.[38][39] Lee's sparring partner, Hawkins Cheung, states, "Probably fewer than six people in
            the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught, or even partly taught, by Ip Man".[40] However, Lee showed
            a keen interest in Wing Chun and continued to train privately with Ip Man, William Cheung, and Wong
            Shun-leung.[41][42] In 1958, Lee won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament, knocking out the previous
            champion, Gary Elms, in
            the final.[24] That year, Lee was also a cha-cha dancer, winning Hong Kong's Crown Colony Cha-Cha
            Championship.</p>
