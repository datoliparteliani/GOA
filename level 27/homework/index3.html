        <h1 class="h1-1">Jackie Chan</h1>
        <p class="p1">Fang Shilong[a] SBS MBE PMW[3] (born Chan Kong-sang[b]; 7 April 1954), known professionally as
            Jackie Chan,[c] is a Hong Kong actor, director, writer, producer, martial artist, and stuntman known for his
            slapstick - acrobatic fighting style, comic timing, and innovative stunts, which he typically performs
            himself. Before entering the film industry, he was one of the Seven Little Fortunes from the China Drama
            Academy at the Peking Opera School, where he studied acrobatics, martial arts, and acting. In a film career
            spanning more than sixty years, he has appeared in over 150 domestic and international movies. Chan is
            regarded as one of the most iconic and influential martial artists in the history of cinema.[4][5] After
            appearing in many Hong Kong films as a stuntman, Chan's first major breakthrough was the 1978 kung fu
            action comedy film Snake in the Eagle's Shadow. He then starred in similar kung fu action comedy films such
            as 1978's Drunken Master and 1980's The Young Master. In 1979, he made his directorial debut with The
            Fearless Hyena, which was a box office success. Throughout the 1980s, he was part of the "Three Dragons"
            along with Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao; the three starred in six Hong Kong films together.[6] 1983's Project A
            saw the official formation of the Jackie Chan Stunt Team and established Chan's signature style of
            elaborate, dangerous stunts combined with martial arts and slapstick humor, a style he further developed in
            a more modern setting with 1984's Wheels on Meals and 1985's Police Story. Rumble in the Bronx (1995), which
            had a successful worldwide theatrical run, brought Chan into the North American mainstream.[7][8] He gained
            international fame for portraying Chief Inspector Lee in the American buddy cop action comedy film Rush Hour
            (1998), a role he reprised in two sequels. Chan continued to work both in Hollywood and Hong Kong cinema,
            appearing in the well-received Shanghai Noon
            (2000) and Shanghai Knights (2003) in the Shanghai film series, New Police Story (2004), Rob-B-Hood (2006),
            Little Big Soldier (2010), and Shaolin (2011), among others. The US-China co-production The Forbidden
            Kingdom (2008) marked his first collaboration with fellow martial arts star Jet Li. He has played martial
            arts mentor Mr. Han in two Karate Kid films, the 2010 remake The Karate Kid and the upcoming Karate Kid:
            Legends (2025). For CZ12 (2012), he earned two Guinness World Records for "Most Stunts Performed by a Living
            Actor" and "Most Credits in One Movie". His against type performances include Shinjuku Incident (2009) and
            The Foreigner (2017).[9][10] His voice acting work includes all three Chinese versions of Mulan (1998), the
            first three films in the Kung Fu Panda franchise (2008-2016), and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant
            Mayhem (2023). The animated television series Jackie Chan Adventures (2000-2005) focuses on a fictionalized
            version of Chan. Chan is one of the most recognizable and influential film personalities in the world, with
            a widespread
            global following in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres. He has received fame stars on the Hong Kong
            Avenue of Stars and the Hollywood Walk of Fame,[11][12] as well as an honorary Academy Award for his
            "extraordinary achievements" in film. Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, films, and
            video games. He is an operatically trained vocalist and is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star, having
            released a number of music albums and sung many of the theme songs for the films in which he has starred. He
            is also a globally known philanthropist and has been named one of the top 10 most charitable celebrities by
            Forbes magazine.[13][14] In 2004, film scholar Andrew Willis stated that Chan was perhaps the "most
            recognized film star in the world."[15] In 2015, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $350 million, and as
            of 2016, he was the second-highest-paid actor in the world.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-1">Career</h2>
        <p class="p2">He began his film career by appearing in small roles at the age of five as a child actor. At age
            eight, he appeared with some of his fellow "Little Fortunes" in the film Big and Little Wong Tin Bar (1962)
            with Li Li-Hua playing his mother. The following year, the young actor appeared in extras of Yen Chun's 1964
            film Liang Shan Po and Chu Ying Tai and had a small role in King Hu's 1966 film Come Drink with Me.[31] In
            1971, after an appearance as an extra in another kung Fu film, A Touch of Zen, Chan was signed to Chu Mu's
            Great Earth Film Company.[32] Chan appeared in the Bruce Lee film Fist of Fury (1972), both as an extra and
            as a stunt double for the Japanese villain Hiroshi Suzuki (portrayed by Chikara Hashimoto), particularly
            during the final fight scene
            where Lee kicks him and he flies through the air.[33][34] Chan again appeared in another Bruce Lee film,
            Enter the Dragon (1973), as a minor henchman who gets killed by Lee's character. Sammo Hung helped Chan get
            minor roles in both of the Bruce Lee films.[35] Chan also worked as a martial arts choreographer for John
            Woo's The Young Dragons (1974).</p>
