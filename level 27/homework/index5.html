        <h1 class="h1-1">Sylvester Stallone</h1>
        <p class="p1">Sylvester Gardenzio Stallone (/stəˈloʊn/; born July 6, 1946) is an American actor and filmmaker.
            He has received numerous accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a Critics' Choice Award, as well as
            nominations for three Academy Awards and two BAFTA Awards. Stallone is one of only two actors in history
            (alongside Harrison Ford) to have starred in a box-office No. 1 film across six consecutive decades.[2][3]
            Struggling as an actor for a number of years upon moving to New York City in 1969, Stallone found gradual
            work in films such as The Lords of Flatbush (1974). He achieved his greatest critical and commercial success
            starting in 1976 with his iconic role as boxer Rocky Balboa in the first film of the successful Rocky
            franchise, which he also wrote.[4] In 1977, he became the third actor in history to be nominated for two
            Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor. He portrayed the PTSD-plagued soldier John Rambo
            in First Blood (1982), a role he would play across five Rambo films (1982–2019). From the mid-1980s to the
            late 1990s, Stallone would go on to become one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors acting in action films
            such as Cobra (1986), Tango and Cash (1989), Cliffhanger (1993), Demolition Man (1993), and The Specialist
            (1994). He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1984. Stallone continued his established roles
            in Rocky Balboa (2006) and Rambo (2008) before launching The
            Expendables film franchise (2010–present), in which he starred as the mercenary Barney Ross. In 2013, he
            starred in the successful film Escape Plan and appeared in its sequels. In 2015, he returned to Rocky again
            with Creed, in which a retired Rocky mentors former rival Apollo Creed's son Donnie Creed. The film brought
            Stallone widespread praise and his first Golden Globe Award, as well as a third Academy Award nomination,
            having been first nominated for the same role 40 years prior. Since 2022, he has starred in the Paramount+
            crime series Tulsa King.</p>

        <h2 class="h2-1">Career </h2>
        <p class="p2">Until 1969, he appeared on the stage under the name Mike Stallone; in 1970, he started using the
            stage name Sylvester E. Stallone. While attending the University of Miami, Stallone had a role in the drama
            That Nice Boy (aka The Square Root), filmed in 1968.[31][32][33] Moreover, he and John Herzfeld worked
            together in 1969 on a low-budget self-produced film called "Horses".[34] Stallone had his first starring
            role in the softcore pornography feature film The Party at Kitty and Stud's
            (1970). He was paid US$200 for two days' work.[35] Stallone later explained that he had done the film out of
            desperation after being evicted from his apartment and finding himself homeless for several days. He has
            also said that he slept three weeks in the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City prior to seeing a
            casting notice for the film. In the actor's words, "it was either do that movie or rob someone, because I
            was at the end – the very end – of my rope".[36] The film was released several years later as Italian
            Stallion, in order to cash in on Stallone's newfound fame (the new title was taken from Stallone's nickname
            since Rocky). Stallone also starred in the erotic off-Broadway stage play Score which ran for 23
            performances at the Martinique Theatre from October 28 to November 15, 1971, and was later made into the
            1974 film Score by Radley Metzger.[37] After moving to New York City, Stallone shared an apartment with his
            girlfriend, Sasha Czack, an aspiring
            actress who supported them by working as a waitress.[38] Stallone took odd jobs around this time, including
            being a cleaner at a zoo, and a theater usher; he was fired from the latter for scalping tickets. He
            furthered his writing skills by frequenting a local library, and became interested in the works of Edgar
            Allan Poe.[39] In 1972, Stallone was on the verge of giving up on having an acting career; in what he later
            described as a
            low point, he tried and failed to get a job as an extra in The Godfather.[40][41] Instead, he was relegated
            to a background role in another Hollywood hit, What's Up, Doc?, starring Barbra Streisand. Stallone is
            hardly visible in his two appearances. Stallone happened to be acting in a play that a friend invited him to
            partake in, and an agent in attendance
            thought that Stallone fit the role of Stanley, a main character in The Lords of Flatbush, which had a
            start-stop schedule from 1972 to 1974 over budget issues.[42] Stallone, around mid-1973, achieved his first
            proper starring role, in the independent film No Place to Hide, playing a man who is associated with a New
            York–based urban terrorist movement, with a jewelry-seller as his love interest. The film was re-cut and
            retitled Rebel years later, this second version featuring Stallone as its star. In 1990, this film was
            re-edited with outtakes from the original film and newly shot matching footage, then redubbed – in the style
            of Woody Allen's What's Up, Tiger Lily? – into a parody of itself titled A Man Called... Rainbo. Stallone's
            other first few film roles were minor, and included brief uncredited appearances in M*A*S*H
            (1970), as a soldier sitting at a table; Pigeons (1970), as a party guest; Woody Allen's Bananas (1971), as
            a subway thug; in the psychological thriller Klute (1971), as an extra dancing in a club; and in the Jack
            Lemmon film The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1975), as a youth. In the latter film, Jack Lemmon's character
            chases, tackles, and mugs Stallone, thinking that Stallone's character is a pickpocket. He had his second
            starring role in 1974, in The Lords of Flatbush.[18] In 1975, he played supporting roles in Farewell, My
            Lovely; Capone; and Death Race 2000. He made guest appearances on the TV series Police Story and Kojak. He
            is also supposedly in Mandingo. It is often said that his scene was deleted.[43] Stallone gained worldwide
            fame with his starring role in the smash hit Rocky (1976), a sports drama about a
            struggling boxer, Rocky Balboa, taking on heavyweight champion Apollo Creed.[18] On March 24, 1975, Stallone
            saw the Muhammad Ali vs. Chuck Wepner fight. That night Stallone went home, and after three days he had
            completed the first draft of Rocky.[44] Stallone subsequently denied that Wepner provided any inspiration
            for the script; however, Wepner filed a lawsuit which was eventually settled with Stallone for an
            undisclosed amount.[45][46] Other possible inspirations for the film may have included Rocky Graziano's
            autobiography Somebody Up There Likes Me, and the film of the same name. Stallone attempted to sell the
            script to multiple studios, with the intention of playing the lead role himself. Irwin Winkler and Robert
            Chartoff became interested and offered Stallone US$350,000 for the rights, but they had their own casting
            ideas for the lead role, including Robert Redford and Burt Reynolds. Stallone refused to sell unless he
            played the lead character – and, eventually, after a substantial budget cut to compromise, it was agreed he
            could be the star.[47] Upon its release, critic Roger Ebert stated that Stallone could become the next
            Marlon Brando. In 1977, at the 49th Academy Awards, Rocky was nominated for ten Oscars, including Best Actor
            and Best
            Original Screenplay nominations for Stallone. The film went on to win the Academy Awards for Best Picture,
            Best Directing, and Best Film Editing. Rocky has since been inducted into the National Film Registry and had
            its props placed in the Smithsonian Museum. Stallone's use of the front entrance to the Philadelphia Museum
            of Art in the Rocky series led the area to be nicknamed the Rocky Steps, and the city has a statue of the
            Rocky character placed permanently near the museum. The character was also voted into the International
            Boxing Hall of Fame.</p>
