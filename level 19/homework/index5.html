                <h2>Introduction to Web Development</h2>
                <p><strong>Web development</strong> is the process of creating websites and web applications. It
                    involves a
                    combination of programming, design, and user experience (UX) principles to build functional,
                    attractive,
                    and responsive websites. Web development includes everything from writing code to managing
                    databases,
                    ensuring accessibility, and optimizing websites for various devices and platforms.</p>

                    <h3>The Three Main Areas of Web Development</h3>
                    <p>Web development is typically broken down into three key areas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Frontend Development</strong> – The part of web development that involves building
                            the
                            user interface (UI) and the client-side experience. It focuses on the design, layout, and
                            interaction elements of a website.</li>
                        <li><strong>Backend Development</strong> – The server-side part of web development, which deals
                            with
                            databases, server logic, and data management. Backend developers work with languages like
                            PHP,
                            Python, and Node.js.</li>
                        <li><strong>Full-stack Development</strong> – A combination of both frontend and backend
                            development. Full-stack developers are capable of building both the client-side and
                            server-side
                            parts of a web application.</li>
                    </ul>
                </article>

                    <h3>Why Web Development is Important</h3>
                    <p>Web development is crucial because almost every business, organization, and individual needs an
                        online presence in today’s digital world. Whether you're running a small blog, a personal
                        portfolio,
                        or a large e-commerce site, web development helps create websites that are functional, secure,
                        and
                        user-friendly. Additionally, web development plays a key role in improving accessibility,
                        performance, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization) to reach a broader audience.</p>
