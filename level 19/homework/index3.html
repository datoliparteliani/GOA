                <h2>What is Shawarma?</h2>
                <p><strong>Shawarma</strong> is a popular Middle Eastern dish made of thinly sliced cuts of seasoned
                    meat,
                    typically lamb, chicken, or beef, which is cooked on a vertical rotisserie. The meat is marinated
                    with
                    spices such as cumin, paprika, and garlic, then slow-cooked for hours. Once the meat is tender, it
                    is
                    sliced thinly and served with a variety of accompaniments, like fresh vegetables, sauces, and
                    flatbreads, making it a flavorful and satisfying meal.</p>

                    <h3>The History of Shawarma</h3>
                    <p>Shawarma has ancient roots in the Middle East and is believed to have originated in Turkey, where
                        it
                        is called " döner kebab." The dish was later adapted in the Levant region (which includes
                        countries
                        like Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan), where it evolved into the version we know today. Shawarma
                        gained
                        popularity worldwide in the late 20th century as people from the Middle East moved to different
                        parts of the world, bringing this delicious dish with them. It has since become a global street
                        food, beloved by foodies everywhere.</p>
