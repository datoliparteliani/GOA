                <h2>About Our Location</h2>
                <p>Tbilisi (English: /təbɪˈliːsi, təˈbɪlɪsi/ ⓘ tə-bil-EE-see, tə-BIL-iss-ee;[7] Georgian: თბილისი,
                    pronounced [ˈtʰbilisi] ⓘ), in some languages still known by its pre-1936 name Tiflis[a] (/ˈtɪflɪs/ ⓘ
                    TIF-liss),[7] (Georgian: ტფილისი, romanized: t'pilisi) is the capital and largest city of Georgia,
                    lying
                    on the banks of the Kura River with around 1.2 million inhabitants, which is about a third of the
                    country's population. Tbilisi was founded in the fifth century AD by Vakhtang I of Iberiaz; since
                    then,
                    the city has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and
                    1917,
                    then part of the Russian Empire, Tiflis was the seat of the Caucasus Viceroyalty, governing both the
                    northern and the southern parts of the Caucasus.[8][9] Because of its location at the crossroads
                    between
                    Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative Silk Road, throughout history, Tbilisi has been
                    a
                    point of contention among various global powers. To this day, the city's location ensures its
                    position
                    as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its
                    architecture, which is a mix of medieval, neoclassical, Beaux Arts, Art Nouveau, Stalinist, and
                    Modern
                    structures. Historically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and
                    religious
                    backgrounds, though its population is overwhelmingly Eastern Orthodox Christian. Notable tourist
                    destinations include cathedrals Sameba and Sioni, Freedom Square, Rustaveli Avenue and Agmashenebeli
                    Avenue, medieval Narikala Fortress, the pseudo-Moorish Opera Theater, and the Georgian National
                    Museum.
                    The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from 20 to 32 °C (68 to 90 °F) in summer and −1 to 7 °C (30 to
                    45
                    °F) in winter.</p>

                    <h3>Our History</h3>
                    <p>Archaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi
                        since
                        the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age.[12] During the late
                        Bronze
                        Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus.[13] According to legend,
                        the
                        present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted
                        variant
                        of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. c. 447/49 – 502/22)
                        went
                        hunting in the heavily wooded region with a falcon (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either
                        a
                        hawk or other small birds of prey in the legend). The king's falcon allegedly caught or injured
                        a
                        pheasant during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby hot spring and died from
                        burns.
                        King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and
                        build
                        a city on the location. King Dachi of Iberia (r. 522–534), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved
                        the
                        capital of Iberia from Mtskheta to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that
                        lined
                        the city's new boundaries.[14] From the sixth century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the
                        region's strategic location along with important trade and travel routes between Europe and
                        Asia.
